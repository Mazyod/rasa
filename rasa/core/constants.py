# of the rule based policies predict an action and intent prediction
# policy predicts one, its prediction is chosen by the ensemble and
# then the ML based policies are again run to get the prediction for
# an actual action. To prevent an infinite loop, intent prediction
# policies only predict an action if the last event in
# the tracker is of type `UserUttered`. Hence, they make at most
# one action prediction in each conversation turn. This allows other
