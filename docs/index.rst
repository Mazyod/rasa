Welcome to the Rasa Documentation!
----------------------------------

*what am I looking at?*

    Rasa is a framework for building conversational software:
    Messenger/Slack bots, Alexa skills, etc. We'll abbreviate this as a 'bot'
    in this documentation. You can

    - write your bots logic in python code (recommended),
    - or use Rasa Core as a webservice (experimental, see :ref:`section_http`).

*what's cool about it?*

    Rather than a bunch of ``if/else`` statements, the logic of your bot is
    based on a probabilistic model trained on example conversations.

*that sounds harder than writing a few if statements*

    In the beginning of a project, it's indeed easier to just hard code some logic. 
    Rasa helps you when you want to go past that and create a bot that can handle more complexity.

*Can I see it in action?*

    We thought you'd never ask! Check out :ref:`tutorial_scratch` .
