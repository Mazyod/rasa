       with your backend components.

Running the Server
==================

Running the HTTP server
-----------------------

You can run a simple http server that handles requests using your
models with:

.. code-block:: bash

    rasa run \
        --enable-api \
        -m models \
        -o out.log

All the endpoints this API exposes are documented in :ref:`http-api` .

The different parameters are:

- ``--enable-api``, enables this additional API
- ``-m``, which is the path to the folder containing your Rasa model.
- ``-o``, which is the path to the log file.


.. warning::

    Make sure to secure your server, either by restricting access to the server (e.g. using firewalls) or
    by enabling one of the authentication methods: :ref:`server_security`.


.. note::

    If you are using custom actions - make sure your action server is 
    running (see :ref:`run-action-server`). If your actions are running
    on a different machine, or you aren't using the Rasa SDk, make sure
    to update your ``endpoints.yml`` file.


.. note::

    If you start the server with only a Rasa NLU model, not all the available endpoints
    can be called. Be aware that some endpoint will return a 409 status code, as a trained
    Rasa Core model is needed to process the request.


Fetching Models from a Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can configure the http server to fetch models from another URL:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ rasa run \
        --enable-api \
        -m models \
        --endpoints my_endpoints.yaml \
        -o out.log

The model server is specified in the endpoint configuration
(``my_endpoints.yaml``), where you specify the server URL Rasa
regularly queries for zipped Rasa models:

.. code-block:: yaml

    models:
      url: http://my-server.com/models/default@latest
      wait_time_between_pulls:  10   # [optional](default: 100)

.. note::

    If you want to pull the model just once from the server, set
    ``wait_time_between_pulls`` to ``None``.

.. note::

    Your model server must provide zipped Rasa models, and have
    ``{"ETag": <model_hash_string>}`` as one of its headers. Rasa will
    only download a new model if this model hash changed.

Rasa sends requests to your model server with an ``If-None-Match``
header that contains the current model hash. If your model server can
provide a model with a different hash from the one you sent, it should send it
in as a zip file with an ``ETag`` header containing the new hash. If not, Rasa
expects an empty response with a ``204`` or ``304`` status code.

An example request Rasa might make to your model server looks like this:

.. code-block:: bash

      $ curl --header "If-None-Match: d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e" http://my-server.com/models/default@latest


Fetching Models from a Remote Storage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also configure the Rasa server to fetch your model from a remote storage:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ rasa run \
        --enable-api \
        -m 20190506-100418.tar.gz \
        --remote-storage aws \
        -o out.log

The model will be downloaded and stored in a temporary directory on your local storage system.
For more information see :ref:`_section_persistence`


.. _server_security:

Security Considerations
-----------------------

We recommend to not expose the Rasa Server to the outside world but
rather connect to it from your backend over a private connection (e.g.
between docker containers).

Nevertheless, there are two authentication methods built in:

**Token Based Auth:**

Pass in the token using ``--auth-token thisismysecret`` when starting
the server:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ rasa run core \
        --enable-api \
        --auth-token thisismysecret \
        -m models \
        -o out.log

Your requests should pass the token, in our case ``thisismysecret``,
as a parameter:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ curl -XGET localhost:5005/conversations/default/tracker?token=thisismysecret

**JWT Based Auth:**

Enable JWT based authentication using ``--jwt-secret thisismysecret``.
Requests to the server need to contain a valid JWT token in
the ``Authorization`` header that is signed using this secret
and the ``HS256`` algorithm.

The user must have ``username`` and ``role`` attributes.
If the ``role`` is ``admin``, all endpoints are accessible.
If the ``role`` is ``user``, endpoints with a ``sender_id`` parameter are only accessible
if the ``sender_id`` matches the user's ``username``.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ rasa run core \
        --enable-api \
        --jwt-secret thisismysecret \
        -m models \
        -o out.log

Your requests should have set a proper JWT header:

.. code-block:: text

    "Authorization": "Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ"
                     "zdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIi"
                     "wiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.qdrr2_a7Sd80gmCWjnDomO"
                     "Gl8eZFVfKXA6jhncgRn-I"




Endpoint Configuration
----------------------

To connect Rasa to other endpoints, you can specify an endpoint
configuration within a `YAML <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML>`_ file.
Then run Rasa with the flag
``--endpoints <path to endpoint configuration.yml``.

For example:

.. code-block:: bash

    rasa run \
        --m <Rasa model> \
        --endpoints <path to endpoint configuration>.yml

.. note::
    You can use environment variables within configuration files by specifying them with ``${name of environment variable}``.
    These placeholders are then replaced by the value of the environment variable.

Connecting a Tracker Store
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To configure a tracker store within your endpoint configuration,
please see :ref:`tracker_store`.

Connecting an Event Broker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To configure an event broker within your endpoint configuration,
please see :ref:`brokers`.
