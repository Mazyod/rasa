When to Deploy Your Assistant
-----------------------------

.. raw:: html

    The best time to deploy your assistant and make it available to test users is once it can handle the most important happy paths or is what we call a <a style="text-decoration: none" href="https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/glossary">minimum viable assistant</a>.

The recommended deployment methods described below make it easy to share your assistant with test users via the `share your assistant feature in Rasa X <https://rasa.com/docs/rasa-x/user-guide/enable-workflows#conversations-with-test-users>`_. Then, when youâ€™re ready to make your assistant available via one or more :ref:`messaging-and-voice-channels`, you can easily add them to your existing deployment set up.

Recommended Deployment Methods
------------------------------

The recommended way to deploy an assistant is using either the Docker Compose or Kubernetes/Openshift options we support. Both deploy Rasa X and your assistant. They are the easiest ways to deploy your assistant, allow you to use Rasa X to view conversations and turn them into training data, and are production-ready.

Kubernetes/Openshift
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Kubernetes or Openshift is the best option if you need a scalable architecture. It's straightforward to deploy if you use the helm charts we provide. However, you can also customize the Helm charts if you have specific requirements.

    - Default: Read the `Deploying in Openshift or Kubernetes <https://rasa.com/docs/rasa-x/installation-and-setup/openshift-kubernetes/>`_ docs.
    - Custom: Read the above, as well as the `Advanced Configuration <https://rasa.com/docs/rasa-x/installation-and-setup/openshift-kubernetes/#advanced-configuration>`_
      documentation, and customize the `open source Helm charts <https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa-x-helm>`_ to your needs.

Docker Compose
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    - Default: Watch the `Masterclass Video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUYdwy8HPVc>`_ on deploying Rasa X or read the `Docker-Compose Quick Install <https://rasa.com/docs/rasa-x/installation-and-setup/docker-compose-script/>`_ docs.
    - Custom: Read the docs `Docker-Compose Manual Install <https://rasa.com/docs/rasa-x/installation-and-setup/docker-compose-manual/>`_ documentation for full customization options.

Alternative Deployment
----------------------

It is also possible to deploy a Rasa assistant using Docker-Compose without Rasa X. To do so, you can build your
Rasa Assistant locally or in Docker. Then you can deploy your model in Docker-Compose.
