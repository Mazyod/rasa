title: Rules
description: Use Rasa Open Source rules to respond to FAQs, fill forms, or handle fallbacks gracefully.
abstract: Rasa rules are a type of training data used to train Rasa's dialogue management models.
  Rules describe short pieces of conversations that should always follow the same path.
---

Rules can be useful when implementing: 

* [One-turn interactions](./chitchat-faqs.mdx): Some messages do not require any context to answer them. 
  Rules are an easy way to map intents to responses, specifying fixed answers to these messages.

* [Fallback behavior](./fallback-handoff.mdx):
  In combination with the [FallbackClassifier](./components.mdx#fallbackclassifier),
  you can write rules to respond to low-confidence user messages with a certain fallback behavior.

* [Forms](./forms.mdx): Both activating and submitting a form will often follow a fixed path.
  You can also write rules to handle [unexpected input](./unexpected-input.mdx) during a form.


**Don't overuse rules**. Rules are great to handle small specific conversation patterns, but
unlike [stories](./stories.mdx), rules don't have the power to generalize to unseen conversation
paths. Combine rules and stories to make your assistant robust and able to handle
real user behavior.

If you can't decide whether to write a story or a rule to implement a certain behavior, see the 
best practices for [Writing Stories](./writing-stories.mdx)).

## Writing a Rule

Before you start writing rules, you have to make sure that the
[Rule Policy](./policies.mdx#rule-policy) is added to your model configuration:

```yaml-rasa
policies:
- ... # Other policies
- name: RulePolicy
```

Rules can then be added to the `rules` section of your training data.

To indicate that a rule can apply at any point in a conversation, start with the
intent which starts the conversation and then add the actions which your assistant
should perform in response to that.

```yaml-rasa
rules:
- rule: Say `hello` whenever the user sends a message with intent `greet`
  steps:
  - intent: greet
  - action: utter_greet
```

This example rule applies at the start of conversation as well as when the user decides
to a send a message with an intent `greet` in the middle of an ongoing conversation.

### Rules for the Conversation Start

To write a rule which only applies at the beginning of a conversation, add a
`conversation_start: True` to your rule:

```yaml-rasa
rules:

- rule: Say `hello` when the user starts a conversation with intent `greet`
  conversation_start: True
  steps:
  - intent: greet
  - action: utter_greet
```

If a user starts by sending a message with an intent other than `greet`, and sends a
message with intent `greet` later in the conversation, the rule will not match.

### Rules with Pre-Conditions

Rules can describe requirements which have to be fulfilled for the rule to be
applicable. To do so, add any information about the prior conversation, under the
`condition`:

```yaml-rasa
rules:

- rule: Only say `hello` when the user provided a name
  condition:
  - slot_was_set: 
    - user_provided_name: true
  steps:
  - intent: greet
  - action: utter_greet
```

### Skip Waiting for User Input at the End of a Rule

By default, rules will wait for the next user message when finished with the last step:

```yaml-rasa
rules:

- rule: Rule which will wait for user message when it was applied
  steps:
  - intent: greet
  - action: utter_greet
  # Every rule implicitly includes a prediction for `action_listen` as last step.
  # This means that Rasa Open Source will wait for the next user message.
  - action: action_listen
```

If you want to hand over to another story or rule, add `wait_for_user_input: False`
to your rule:

```yaml-rasa
rules:

- rule: Rule which will not wait for user message once it was applied
  steps:
  - intent: greet
  - action: utter_greet
  wait_for_user_input: False
```

This indicates that the assistant should execute another action
before waiting for more user input.

### Rules and Forms

When a [Form](./forms.mdx) is active, the bot will make predictions based on
how the form is defined, ignoring rules. Rules become applicable again if:

- the form fills all required slots
- the form rejects its execution (see
[Handling unhappy paths](./forms.mdx#writing-stories--rules-for-unhappy-form-paths) for
 more details)
