Actions are the things your bot runs in response to user input.
There are four kinds of actions in Rasa:

1. **Utterance actions**: start with `utter_` and send a specific message
   to the user.

2. **Retrieval actions**: start with `respond_` and send a message selected by a retrieval model.

3. **Custom actions**: run arbitrary code and send any number of messages (or none).

4. **Default actions**: e.g. `action_listen`, `action_restart`,
   `action_default_fallback`.

## Utterance Actions

To define an utterance action (`ActionUtterTemplate`), add a response to the domain file
that starts with `utter_`:

```yaml
responses:
  utter_my_message:
    - "this is what I want my action to say!"
```

It is conventional to start the name of an utterance action with `utter_`.
If this prefix is missing, you can still use the response in your custom
actions, but the response can not be directly predicted as its own action.
See [Responses](./responses) for more details.

If you use an external NLG service, you don’t need to specify the
responses in the domain, but you still need to add the utterance names
to the actions list of the domain.

## Retrieval Actions

Retrieval actions make it easier to work with a large number of similar intents like chitchat and FAQs.
See [Retrieval Actions](./retrieval-actions) to learn more.

## Custom Actions

An action can run any code you want. Custom actions can turn on the lights,
add an event to a calendar, check a user’s bank balance, or anything
else you can imagine.

Rasa will call an endpoint you can specify, when a custom action is
predicted. This endpoint should be a webserver that reacts to this
call, runs the code and optionally returns information to modify
the dialogue state.

To specify, your action server use the `endpoints.yml`:

```yaml
action_endpoint:
  url: "http://localhost:5055/webhook"
```

And pass it to the scripts using `--endpoints endpoints.yml`.

You can create an action server in node.js, .NET, java, or any
other language and define your actions there - but we provide
a small python SDK to make development there even easier.

:::note
Rasa uses a ticket lock mechanism to ensure incoming messages from the same
conversation ID do not interfere with each other and are processed in the right
order. If you expect your custom action to take more than 60 seconds to run, please
set the `TICKET_LOCK_LIFETIME` environment variable to your expected value.

### Custom Actions Written in Python

For actions written in python, we have a convenient [Rasa SDK](../api/rasa-sdk) which starts
this action server for you.

## Execute Actions in Other Code

Rasa will send an HTTP `POST` request to your server containing
information on which action to run. Furthermore, this request will contain all
information about the conversation. [Action Server](../api/action-server) shows the detailed API spec.

As a response to the action call from Rasa, you can modify the tracker,
e.g. by setting slots and send responses back to the user.
All of the modifications are done using events.
There is a list of all possible event types in [Events](../api/events).
