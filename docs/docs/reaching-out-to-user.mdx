Sometimes you want your assistant to reach out to the user without the user's prompting.
For example, you might want the assistant to send a message when the user opens the chat window,
or you might want to prompt the user if they haven't sent a message for a while. 
This page is a guide to enabling your assistant to reach out to the user proactively.


## Concepts

### Reaching out first

To have your assistant reach out to the user at the beginning of a conversation,
configure your [messaging or voice channel]() to send a payload to the bot that 
will trigger the appropriate response. For example, in Sara, the Rasa bot, when a 
user opens the chat window, the chat widget sends the payload `/greet`, so that
Sara greets the user with a welcome message. How you send the initial payload
will depend on the channel(s) you are using. 

On the bot's side,
you might want to reuse an existing intent and response, or have a specific
intent and response for the start of conversations. If you want a specific welcome
message that the user won't also see by e.g. greeting the bot, you need
to add the intent and response(s) to your domain, and add a rule
for what the bot should do with the initial payload. For example:

```rasa-yaml
intents: 
- chat_opened

responses:
  utter_welcome:
  - text: Hi, I'm Sara! What can I help you with today?

rules:
  - rule: welcome user
    steps:
      - intent: chat_opened
      - action: utter_welcome
```

Since there's no training data for the intent `chat_opened`, the intent can only
be triggered explicitly by sending `/chat_opened`, which is what your channel
should send to the bot. 

### External Events

You might want to reach out to the user based on an
[external event](reminders-and-external-events.mdx#external-events).
