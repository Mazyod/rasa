## What are slots?

**Slots are your bot’s memory.** They act as a key-value store
which can be used to store information the user provided (e.g their home city)
as well as information gathered about the outside world (e.g. the result of a
database query).

Most of the time, you want slots to influence how the dialogue progresses.
There are different slot types for different behaviors.

For example, if your user has provided their home city, you might
have a `text` slot called `home_city`. If the user asks for the
weather, and you *don’t* know their home city, you will have to ask
them for it. A `text` slot only tells Rasa Core whether the slot
has a value. The specific value of a `text` slot (e.g. Bangalore
or New York or Hong Kong) doesn’t make any difference.

If the value itself is important, use a `categorical` or a `bool` slot.
There are also `float`, and `list` slots.
If you just want to store some data, but don’t want it to affect the flow
of the conversation, use an `unfeaturized` slot.

## How Rasa Uses Slots

The `Policy` doesn’t have access to the
value of your slots. It receives a featurized representation.
As mentioned above, for a `text` slot the value is irrelevant.
The policy just sees a `1` or `0` depending on whether it is set.

**You should choose your slot types carefully!**

## How Slots Get Set

You can provide an initial value for a slot in your domain file:

```yaml
slots:
  name:
    type: text
    initial_value: "human"
```

You can get the value of a slot using `.get_slot()` inside `actions.py` for example:

```python
data = tracker.get_slot("slot-name")
```

There are multiple ways that slots are set during a conversation:

### Slots Set from NLU

If your NLU model picks up an entity, and your domain contains a
slot with the same name, the slot will be set automatically. For example:

```story
# story_01
* greet{"name": "Ali"}
  - slot{"name": "Ali"}
  - utter_greet
```

In this case, you don’t have to include the `- slot{}` part in the
story, because it is automatically picked up.

To disable this behavior for a particular slot, you can set the
`auto_fill` attribute to `False` in the domain file:

```yaml
slots:
  name:
    type: text
    auto_fill: False
```

### Slots Set By Clicking Buttons

You can use buttons as a shortcut.
Rasa Core will send messages starting with a `/` to the
`RegexInterpreter`, which expects NLU input in the same format
as in story files, e.g. `/intent{entities}`. For example, if you let
users choose a color by clicking a button, the button payloads might
be `/choose{"color": "blue"}` and `/choose{"color": "red"}`.

You can specify this in your domain file like this:
(see details in [Domains](./domains))

```yaml
utter_ask_color:
- text: "what color would you like?"
  buttons:
  - title: "blue"
    payload: '/choose{"color": "blue"}'
  - title: "red"
    payload: '/choose{"color": "red"}'
```

### Slots Set by Actions

The second option is to set slots by returning events in [custom actions](./actions#custom-actions).
In this case, your stories need to include the slots.
For example, you have a custom action to fetch a user’s profile, and
you have a `categorical` slot called `account_type`.
When the `fetch_profile` action is run, it returns a
[`rasa.core.events.SlotSet`](../api/events#rasa.core.events.SlotSet) event:

```yaml
slots:
   account_type:
      type: categorical
      values:
      - premium
      - basic
```

```python
from rasa_sdk.actions import Action
from rasa_sdk.events import SlotSet
import requests

class FetchProfileAction(Action):
    def name(self):
        return "fetch_profile"

    def run(self, dispatcher, tracker, domain):
        url = "http://myprofileurl.com"
        data = requests.get(url).json
        return [SlotSet("account_type", data["account_type"])]
```

```story
# story_01
* greet
  - action_fetch_profile
  - slot{"account_type" : "premium"}
  - utter_welcome_premium

# story_02
* greet
  - action_fetch_profile
  - slot{"account_type" : "basic"}
  - utter_welcome_basic
```

In this case you **do** have to include the `- slot{}` part in your stories.
Rasa Core will learn to use this information to decide on the correct action to
take (in this case, `utter_welcome_premium` or `utter_welcome_basic`).

:::note
It is **very easy** to forget about slots if you are writing
stories by hand. We strongly recommend that you build up these
stories using [Interactive Learning with Forms](./interactive-learning#section-interactive-learning-forms) rather than writing them.
