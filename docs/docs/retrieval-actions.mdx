description: Use a retrieval model to select chatbot responses in open source bot framework Rasa.
---

Retrieval actions are designed to make it simpler to work with small talk and simple questions.
For example, if your assistant can handle 100 FAQs and 50 different small talk intents, you can use a single retrieval
action to cover all of these.
From a dialogue perspective, these single-turn exchanges can all be treated equally, so this simplifies your stories.

Instead of having a lot of stories like:

```yaml-rasa
stories:
- story: weather
  steps:
  - intent: ask_weather
  - action: utter_ask_weather

- story: introduction
  steps:
  - intent: ask_name
  - action: utter_introduce_myself

# ...
```

You can cover all of these with a single story where the above intents are grouped
under a common `chitchat` intent:

```yaml-rasa
stories:
- story: chitchat
  steps:
  - intent: chitchat
  - action: respond_chitchat
```

A retrieval action uses the output of a [ResponseSelector](./components.mdx#responseselector) 
pipeline component which learns a retrieval model to predict the correct response
from a list of candidate responses given a user message text.

actions for handling single turn interactions.

## Configuring Retrieval Actions

### Training Data

Retrieval actions learn to select the correct response from a list of candidates.
As with other intent data, you need to include examples of what your users will say in
your training data file:

```yaml-rasa title="data/nlu.yml"
nlu:
- intent: chitchat/ask_name
  examples: |
    - what's your name
    - who are you?
    - what are you called?

- intent: chitchat/ask_weather
  examples: |
    - how's weather?
    - is it sunny where you are?
```

First, all of these examples will be combined into a single `chitchat`
retrieval intent that NLU will predict. All retrieval intents have a suffix
added to them which identifies a particular response key for your assistant. In the
above example, `ask_name` and `ask_weather` are response keys. Response keys are separated from
the intent name by a `/` delimiter.

:::note Special meaning of `/`
As shown in the above examples, the `/` symbol is reserved as a delimiter to separate
retrieval intents from response text identifier. Make sure not to use it in the
names of your non-retrieval intents.
:::

Next, include responses for all retrieval intents in a training data file:

```yaml-rasa title="data/responses.yml"
responses:
  chitchat/ask_name:
    - text: "My name is Sara, Rasa's documentation bot!"

  chitchat/ask_weather:
    - text: "It's always sunny where I live ☀️"
    - text: "It's a beautiful day where I am!"
```

All such responses (e.g. `utter_chitchat/ask_name`) should start with the
`utter_` prefix followed by the retrieval intent name (`chitchat`)
and the associated response key (`ask_name`).

The response variations do however use the same format as the [responses in the domain](responses.mdx).
This means you can also use buttons, images and any other multimedia elements in
your responses, and have multiple response variations for a response.


### Configuration File

You need to include the [ResponseSelector](./components.mdx#responseselector)
component in your configuration. The component needs a tokenizer, a featurizer and an
intent classifier to operate on the user message before it can predict a response.
Therefore the `ResponseSelector` should be placed after these components in the
pipeline configuration. For example:

```yaml-rasa title="config.yml" {8}
language: "en"

pipeline:
- name: "WhitespaceTokenizer"
  intent_split_symbol: "_"
- name: "CountVectorsFeaturizer"
- name: "DIETClassifier"
- name: "ResponseSelector"
```

The retrieval model is trained separately as part of the NLU training pipeline
to select the correct response. The default configuration uses the user message text as input and the retrieval intent combined with the
response key suffix (e.g. `chitchat/ask_name`) as the correct label for that user message. However, the
retrieval model can also be configured to use the text of the response message as the label by setting `use_text_as_label`
to `true` in the component's configuration: 

```yaml-rasa title="config.yml" {8-9}
language: "en"

pipeline:
- name: "WhitespaceTokenizer"
  intent_split_symbol: "_"
- name: "CountVectorsFeaturizer"
- name: "DIETClassifier"
- name: "ResponseSelector"
  use_text_as_label: true
```

### Domain

Rasa uses a naming convention to match a retrieval intent name
to its corresponding retrieval action. 
The `respond_` prefix identifies an action as a retrieval action.

By this convention, the `respond_chitchat` action is configured as a response to the `chitchat`
retrieval intent, and `respond_faq` is a response  to `faq`.

To include a retrieval action in your domain, add it to the list of actions:

```yaml-rasa title="domain.yml"
actions:
  # ...
  - respond_chitchat
  - respond_faq
```

The best way to ensure that the retrieval action is predicted after the chitchat
intent is to a [rule](./rules.mdx). A rule will tell your bot to respond
appropriately to a retrieval intent at any point in the conversation: 

```yaml-rasa title="data/rules.yml" {6-8}
rules:
- rule: respond to chitchat
  steps:
  - intent: chitchat
  - action: respond_chitchat
```

However, you can also include this action in your stories.
For example, if you want to repeat a question after handling unexpected chitchat:

```yaml-rasa title="data/stories.yml" {6-8}
stories:
- story: interruption
  steps:
  - intent: search_restaurant
  - action: utter_ask_cuisine
  - intent: chitchat
  - action: respond_chitchat
  - action: utter_ask_cuisine
```

### Multiple Retrieval Actions

If your assistant includes both FAQs and chitchat, it is possible to
separate these into separate retrieval actions, for example having sub-intents
like `chitchat/ask_weather` and `faq/returns_policy`. Rasa supports adding multiple `RetrievalActions`
like `respond_chitchat` and `respond_faq`. To train separate retrieval models for each of the retrieval intents,
you need to include a separate `ResponseSelector` component in the config for each retrieval intent:

```yaml-rasa title="config.yml" {8-12}
language: "en"

pipeline:
- name: "WhitespaceTokenizer"
  intent_split_symbol: "_"
- name: "CountVectorsFeaturizer"
- name: "DIETClassifier"
- name: "ResponseSelector"
  retrieval_intent: "faq"
- name: "ResponseSelector"
  retrieval_intent: "chitchat"
```

Alternatively, if you want the retrieval actions for both the intents to share a single retrieval model,
specifying just one `ResponseSelector` component is enough.

```yaml-rasa title="config.yml" {8}
language: "en"

pipeline:
- name: "WhitespaceTokenizer"
  intent_split_symbol: "_"
- name: "CountVectorsFeaturizer"
- name: "DIETClassifier"
- name: "ResponseSelector"
```
