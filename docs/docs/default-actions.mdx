title: Default Actions
abstract: Default actions are actions that are built into the dialogue manager by default. Most of these are automatically predicted based on certain conversation situations. You may want to customise these to personalise your assitant.
---

Each of these actions have a default behaviour, described in the sections below.
In order to overwrite this default behavior, write a [custom action](./custom-actions.mdx)
whose `name()` method returns the same name as the default action:

  ```python
  class ActionRestart(Action):

    def name(self) -> Text:
        return "action_restart"

    async def run(
        self, dispatcher, tracker: Tracker, domain: Dict[Text, Any]
    ) -> List[Dict[Text, Any]]:

        # custom behaviour

        return [...]
  ```

Add this action to the actions section of your domain file so your assistant knows
to use the custom definition instead of the default one:

  ```yaml-rasa
  actions:
    - action_restart
  ```

## action_listen
This action is predicted to signal that the assistant should do nothing and wait
for the next user input.

## action_restart
This action resets the whole conversation history, including any slots that were
set during it.

It can be triggered by the user in a conversation by sending a
"/restart" message, if the [RulePolicy](./rules.mdx) is included in the model configuration.
If you define a `utter_restart` response in your domain, this will be sent to the user as well.

## action_session_start

This action starts a new conversation session, and is executed in the following
situations:
  * at the beginning of each conversation new conversation
  * after a user was inactive for a period defined by the `session_expiration_time` parameter in the domain's
[Session configuration](./domain.mdx#session-config).
  * when a user sends a "/session_start" message during a conversation

The action will reset the conversation tracker, but not clear any slots that were set.

### Customization

<!-- TODO: check that the below action definition is right -->

The default behavior of the session start action is to take all existing slots and to
carry them over into the next session. Let's say you do not want to carry over all
slots, but only a user's name and their phone number. To do that, you'd override the
`action_session_start` with a custom action that might look like this:

```python
from typing import Text, List, Dict, Any

from rasa_sdk import Action, Tracker
from rasa_sdk.events import SlotSet, SessionStarted, ActionExecuted, EventType
from rasa_sdk.executor import CollectingDispatcher


class ActionSessionStart(Action):
    def name(self) -> Text:
        return "action_session_start"

    @staticmethod
    def fetch_slots(tracker: Tracker) -> List[EventType]:
        """Collect slots that contain the user's name and phone number."""

        slots = []

        for key in ("name", "phone_number"):
            value = tracker.get_slot(key)
            if value is not None:
                slots.append(SlotSet(key=key, value=value))

        return slots

    async def run(
        self,
        dispatcher: CollectingDispatcher,
        tracker: Tracker,
        domain: Dict[Text, Any],
    ) -> List[EventType]:

        # the session should begin with a `session_started` event
        events = [SessionStarted(metadata=self.metadata)]

        # any slots that should be carried over should come after the
        # `session_started` event
        events.extend(self.fetch_slots(tracker))

        # an `action_listen` should be added at the end as a user message follows
        events.append(ActionExecuted("action_listen"))

        return events
```


The available default actions are:

|                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

|`action_listen`                  |Do nothing, and wait for the next user input                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|`action_restart`                 |Reset the whole conversation, including any slots. Can be triggered during a conversation by sending a "/restart" message if the RulePolicy is included in the configuration.                                                                                                                                                   |
|`action_session_start`           |Start a new conversation session. Take all set slots, mark the beginning of a new conversation session and re-apply the existing `SlotSet` events. This action is triggered automatically after an inactivity period defined by the `session_expiration_time` parameter in the domain's [Session configuration](./domain.mdx#session-config). Can be triggered manually during a conversation by entering `/session_start`. All conversations begin with an `action_session_start`. |
|`action_default_fallback`        |Undo the last user message (as if the user did not send it and the bot did not react) and utter a message that the bot did not understand. See [Fallback Policy](./policies.mdx#fallback-policy).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
