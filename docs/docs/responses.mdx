title: Responses

If you want your assistant to respond to user messages, you need to manage
these responses. In the training data for your bot,
your stories, you specify the actions your bot
should execute. These actions
can use responses to send messages back to the user.

There are three ways to manage these responses:

1. Responses are normally stored in your domain file, see [here](./domains#domain-responses)

2. Retrieval action responses are part of the training data, see [here](./retrieval-actions)

3. You can also create a custom NLG service to generate responses, see [here](./responses#custom-nlg-service)

## Including the responses in the domain

The default format is to include the responses in your domain file.
This file then contains references to all your custom actions,
available entities, slots and intents.

```yaml (docs/sources/data/test_domains/default_with_slots.yml)
```

In this example domain file, the section `responses` contains the
responses the assistant uses to send messages to the user.

:::note
If you want to change the text, or any other part of the bots response,
you need to retrain the assistant before these changes will be picked up.

:::

:::note
Responses that are used in a story should be listed in the `stories`
section of the domain.yml file. In this example, the `utter_channel`
response is not used in a story so it is not listed in that section.

:::

More details about the format of these responses can be found in the
documentation about the domain file format: [Responses](./domains#domain-responses).

## Proactively Reaching Out to the User with External Events

You may want to proactively reach out to the user,
for example to display the output of a long running background operation
or notify the user of an external event.
