title: Slot Validation Actions
abstract: A slot validation action is a special type of custom action, designed to handle custom extraction and/or validation of slot values. This can be used to validate slots with predefined mappings or extract slots with custom mappings.
---

You can use three different types of slot validation actions to write custom extraction and validation of slot values:

## Regular Custom Action

You can use the `Action` Rasa SDK class to create a regular [custom action](./custom-actions.mdx).
The base class will not prevent you from returning arbitrary events, however a slot validation action should only return
`SlotSet` and `BotUttered` events. Any other event type will be filtered out by the default action [`action_extract_slots`](./default-actions.mdx#action_extract_slots).
The name of the custom action must be specified in the `action` key of the relevant [custom slot mapping](./domain.mdx#custom-slot-mappings)
in the domain.
Note that the action name must be listed in the domain `actions` section too.

## `action_validate_slot_mappings`

You can use the `action_validate_slot_mappings` action to define custom extraction and / or validation of slots that
can be set or updated outside of a form context.

This action should extend the Rasa SDK `ValidationAction` class or the implementation of this class in your
custom action server.

With this option, you do not need to specify the `action` key in the [custom slot mapping](./domain.mdx#custom-slot-mappings),
since the default action [`action_extract_slots`](./default-actions.mdx#action_extract_slots) runs `action_validate_slot_mappings`
automatically if present in the `actions` section of the domain.

## `validate_<form name>`

If certain custom slot mappings should only be extracted and / or validated within the context of a form,
the custom action should inherit from the Rasa SDK `FormValidationAction` class or the implementation of this class
in your custom action server.
The `validate_<form name>` action will only run if the form it specifies in its name is activated.
