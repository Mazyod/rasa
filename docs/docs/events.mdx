TODO: This page needs to be rewritten for 2.0!
Ideally it will be sourced from the SDK repo instead (?)
We want to show the user, most importantly, how to use the
events from the SDK. Also helpful would be the JSON form of
the events that make it back to rasa (for example if you
write your own SDK)

All of that info can be found here: [https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa-sdk/blob/master/rasa_sdk/events.py](https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa-sdk/blob/master/rasa_sdk/events.py)

An actionâ€™s `run()` method returns a list of events. For more information on
the different types of events, see [Events](./events). There is an example of a `SlotSet` event
[above](./rasa-sdk#custom-action-example). The action itself will automatically be added to the
tracker as an `ActionExecuted` event. If the action should not trigger any
other events, it should return an empty list.
