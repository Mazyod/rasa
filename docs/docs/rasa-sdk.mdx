Rasa SDK provides the tools you need to write custom actions in python.

## Installation

Use `pip` to install `rasa-sdk` on your action server.

```bash
pip install rasa-sdk
```

:::note
You do not need to install `rasa` for your action server.
E.g. if you are running Rasa in a docker container, it is recommended to
create a separate container for your action server. In this
separate container, you only need to install `rasa-sdk`.

:::

## Running the Action Server

If you have `rasa` installed, run this command to start your action server:

```bash
rasa run actions
```

Otherwise, if you do not have `rasa` installed, run this command:

```bash
python -m rasa_sdk --actions actions
```

You can verify that the action server is up and running with the command:

```bash
curl http://localhost:5055/health
```

You can get the list of registered custom actions with the command:

```bash
curl http://localhost:5055/actions
```

The file that contains your custom actions should be called `actions.py`.
Alternatively, you can use a package directory called `actions` or else
manually specify an actions module or package with the `--actions` flag.

The full list of options for running the action server with either command is:

```text [rasa run actions --help]
```

## Actions

The `Action` class is the base class for any custom action. It has two methods
that both need to be overwritten, `name()` and `run()`.

<a aria-hidden="true" tabIndex="-1" className="anchor enhancedAnchor" id="custom-action-example"></a>

In a restaurant bot, if the user says “show me a Mexican restaurant”,
your bot could execute the action `ActionCheckRestaurants`,
which might look like this:

```python
from rasa_sdk import Action
from rasa_sdk.events import SlotSet

class ActionCheckRestaurants(Action):
   def name(self) -> Text:
      return "action_check_restaurants"

   def run(self,
           dispatcher: CollectingDispatcher,
           tracker: Tracker,
           domain: Dict[Text, Any]) -> List[Dict[Text, Any]]:

      cuisine = tracker.get_slot('cuisine')
      q = "select * from restaurants where cuisine='{0}' limit 1".format(cuisine)
      result = db.query(q)

      return [SlotSet("matches", result if result is not None else [])]
```

You should add the action name `action_check_restaurants` to
the actions in your domain file. The action’s `run()` method receives
three arguments. You can access the values of slots and the latest message
sent by the user using the `tracker` object, and you can send messages
back to the user with the `dispatcher` object, by calling
`dispatcher.utter_message`.

Details of the `run()` method:


#### Action.run
async Action.rundispatcher, tracker, domain**:
Execute the side effects of this action.


* **Parameters**

  * **dispatcher** – the dispatcher which is used to
    send messages back to the user. Use
    `dipatcher.utter_message()` or any other
    `rasa_sdk.executor.CollectingDispatcher`
    method.

  * **tracker** – the state tracker for the current
    user. You can access slot values using
    `tracker.get_slot(slot_name)`, the most recent user message
    is `tracker.latest_message.text` and any other
    `rasa_sdk.Tracker` property.

  * **domain** – the bot’s domain



* **Returns**

  A dictionary of `rasa_sdk.events.Event` instances that is

    returned through the endpoint




* **Return type**

  `List`[`Dict`[`str`, `Any`]]


Details of the `dispatcher.utter_message()` method:


#### CollectingDispatcher.utter_message
CollectingDispatcher.utter_messagetext=None, image=None, json_message=None, template=None, attachment=None, buttons=None, elements=None, \*\*kwargs**:
“Send a text to the output channel


* **Return type**
