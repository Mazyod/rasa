The diagram below provides an overview of the Rasa OSS architecture. The two primary
components are Rasa NLU and Rasa Core.

**Rasa NLU** is the part of Rasa that performs Natural Language Understanding ([NLU](#nlu)), including
intent classification and entity extraction. It's shown below as the *NLU Pipeline* because it processes
user utterances through the NLU model that was generated by the pipeline based on the training
data.

**Rasa Core** is the dialogue engine that decides on what to do next in a conversation based on the
context. This is displayed as the *Dialogue Policies* in the diagram.
