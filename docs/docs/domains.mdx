TODO: make sure all available options are documented for each parameter. also rewrite this whole page.

The `Domain` defines the universe in which your assistant operates.
It specifies the `intents`, `entities`, `slots`, `responses` and `actions`
your bot should know about. It also defines a `session_config` to configure
conversation sessions. 

As an example, the domain created by `rasa init` has the following yaml definition:
TODO: use an example with all of the pieces! e.g. formbot? 

```yml (docs/sources/rasa/cli/initial_project/domain.yml)
```

## Intents

TODO: intro info about intents

### Ignoring entities for certain intents

If you want all entities to be ignored for certain intents, you can
add the `use_entities: []` parameter to the intent in your domain
file like this:

```yaml
intents:
  - greet:
      use_entities: []
```

To ignore some entities or explicitly take only certain entities
into account you can use this syntax:

```yaml
intents:
- greet:
    use_entities:
      - name
      - first_name
    ignore_entities:
      - location
      - age
```

This means that excluded entities for those intents will be unfeaturized and therefore
will not impact the next action predictions. This is useful when you have
an intent where you don’t care about the entities being picked up. If you list
your intents as normal without this parameter, the entities will be
featurized as normal.

:::note
If you really want these entities not to influence action prediction we
suggest you make the slots with the same name of type `unfeaturized`.

:::

## Entities

The `entities` section lists all entities
extracted by any [entity extractor](../nlu/entity-extraction) in your
NLU pipeline.

For example:

```yaml
entities:
   - PERSON          # entity extracted by SpacyEntityExtractor
   - time            # entity extracted by DucklingHTTPExtractor
   - membership_type # custom entity extracted by CRFEntityExtractor
   - priority        # custom entity extracted by CRFEntityExtractor
```

## Slots 

[Slots](./slots) hold information you want to keep track of during a conversation.
A categorical slot called `risk_level` would be
defined like this:

```yaml
slots:
   risk_level:
      type: categorical
      values:
      - low
      - medium
      - high
```

<a aria-hidden="true" tabIndex="-1" className="anchor enhancedAnchor" id="slot-classes"></a>

### Slot Types

Make this a nice table instead

#### Text Slot

* **Option**

  `text`

* **Use For**

  User preferences where you only care whether or not they’ve
  been specified.



* **Example**

  ```yaml
  slots:
     cuisine:
        type: text
  ```



* **Description**

  Results in the feature of the slot being set to `1` if any value is set.
  Otherwise the feature will be set to `0` (no value is set).


#### Boolean Slot


* **Option**

  `bool`

* **Use For**

  True or False



* **Example**

  ```yaml
  slots:
     is_authenticated:
        type: bool
  ```



* **Description**

  Checks if slot is set and if True


#### Categorical Slot

* **Option**

  `categorical`

* **Use For**

  Slots which can take one of N values



* **Example**

  ```yaml
  slots:
     risk_level:
        type: categorical
        values:
        - low
        - medium
        - high
  ```



* **Description**

  Creates a one-hot encoding describing which of the `values` matched.
  A default value `__other__` is automatically added to the user-defined
  values. All values encountered which are not explicitly defined in the
  domain are mapped to `__other__` for featurization. The value
  `__other__` should not be used as a user-defined value; if it is, it
  will still behave as the default to which all unseen values are mapped.


#### Float Slot


* **Option**

  `float`

* **Use For**

  Continuous values



* **Example**

  ```yaml
  slots:
     temperature:
        type: float
        min_value: -100.0
        max_value:  100.0
  ```



* **Defaults**

  `max_value=1.0`, `min_value=0.0`



* **Description**

  All values below `min_value` will be treated as `min_value`, the same
  happens for values above `max_value`. Hence, if `max_value` is set to
  `1`, there is no difference between the slot values `2` and `3.5` in
  terms of featurization (e.g. both values will influence the dialogue in
  the same way and the model can not learn to differentiate between them).


#### List Slot


* **Option**

  `list`

* **Use For**

  Lists of values



* **Example**

  ```yaml
  slots:
     shopping_items:
        type: list
  ```



* **Description**

  The feature of this slot is set to `1` if a value with a list is set,
  where the list is not empty. If no value is set, or the empty list is the
  set value, the feature will be `0`. The **length of the list stored in
  the slot does not influence the dialogue**.


<a aria-hidden="true" tabIndex="-1" className="anchor enhancedAnchor" id="unfeaturized-slot"></a>

#### Unfeaturized Slot

* **Option**

  `unfeaturized`

* **Use For**

  Data you want to store which shouldn’t influence the dialogue flow



* **Example**

  ```yaml
  slots:
     internal_user_id:
        type: unfeaturized
  ```



* **Description**

  There will not be any featurization of this slot, hence its value does
  not influence the dialogue flow and is ignored when predicting the next
  action the bot should run.


#### Custom Slot Types

Maybe your restaurant booking system can only handle bookings
for up to 6 people. In this case you want the *value* of the
slot to influence the next selected action (and not just whether
it’s been specified). You can do this by defining a custom slot class.

In the code below, we define a slot class called `NumberOfPeopleSlot`.
The featurization defines how the value of this slot gets converted to a vector
to our machine learning model can deal with.
Our slot has three possible “values”, which we can represent with
a vector of length `2`.

|        |                |
|--------|----------------|
|`(0,0)` |not yet set     |
|`(1,0)` |between 1 and 6 |
|`(0,1)` |more than 6     |

```python
from rasa.core.slots import Slot

class NumberOfPeopleSlot(Slot):

    def feature_dimensionality(self):
        return 2

    def as_feature(self):
        r = [0.0] * self.feature_dimensionality()
        if self.value:
            if self.value <= 6:
                r[0] = 1.0
            else:
                r[1] = 1.0
        return r
```

Now we also need some training stories, so that Rasa Core
can learn from these how to handle the different situations:

```story
# story1
...
* inform{"people": "3"}
  - action_book_table
...
# story2
* inform{"people": "9"}
  - action_explain_table_limit
```

## Responses

Responses are actions that simply send a message to a user without running any custom code or 
returning events. These responses can be defined directly in the domain file and can include
rich content such as buttons and attachments. For more information on responses,
see [Responses]((../responses)) 

<a aria-hidden="true" tabIndex="-1" className="anchor enhancedAnchor" id="session-config"></a>

## Actions

[Actions](./actions) are the things your bot can actually do.
For example, an action could:

* respond to a user,

* make an external API call,

* query a database, or

* just about anything!

All custom actions should be listed in your domain, except responses which need not be listed 
under `actions:` as they are already listed under `responses:`.

## Session configuration

A conversation session represents the dialogue between the assistant and the user.
Conversation sessions can begin in three ways:

1. the user begins the conversation with the assistant,

2. the user sends their first message after a configurable period of inactivity, or

3. a manual session start is triggered with the `/session_start` intent message.

You can define the period of inactivity after which a new conversation
session is triggered in the domain under the `session_config` key.
`session_expiration_time` defines the time of inactivity in minutes after which a
new session will begin. `carry_over_slots_to_new_session` determines whether
existing set slots should be carried over to new sessions.

The default session configuration looks as follows:

```yaml
session_config:
  session_expiration_time: 60  # value in minutes, 0 means infinitely long
  carry_over_slots_to_new_session: true  # set to false to forget slots between sessions
```

This means that if a user sends their first message after 60 minutes of inactivity, a
new conversation session is triggered, and that any existing slots are carried over
into the new session. Setting the value of `session_expiration_time` to 0 means
that sessions will not end (note that the `action_session_start` action will still
be triggered at the very beginning of conversations).

:::note
A session start triggers the default action `action_session_start`. Its default
implementation moves all existing slots into the new session. Note that all
conversations begin with an `action_session_start`. Overriding this action could
for instance be used to initialize the tracker with slots from an external API
call, or to start the conversation with a bot message. The docs on
[Customizing the session start action](../api/rasa-sdk#custom-session-start) shows you how to do that.
