You can query and
visualize metrics in a frontend tool of your choice (e.g. Metabase, PowerBI)

Measuring a Rasa assistant's success and making strategic investments
will lead to better business outcomes. It will also help you understand
the needs of your end users and better serve them.

Rasa Pro will connect to your production assistant using Kafka.
The pipeline will compute analytics as soon as the docker container is successfully
deployed and connected to your data warehouse and Kafka instances.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A production deployment of Kafka is required to set up Rasa Pro.
  We recommend using [Amazon Managed Streaming for
  Apache Kafka](https://aws.amazon.com/msk/).
- A production deployment of a data lake needs to be connected to
  the data pipeline. Rasa Pro supports the following data lakes:

  - [PostgreSQL](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql/) (**recommended**. All PostgreSQL >= 11.0 are supported)
  - [Amazon Redshift](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/)

  We recommend managed deployments of your data lake to minimize maintenance
  efforts.

### Connect an assistant

The `<DATA_LAKE_URL>` should have a DBAPI format, e.g.
`postgresql+psycopg2://user:password@postgres.host:5432/rasa`.
If no data lake URL is configured, [Analytics](../monitoring/analytics.mdx)
will be disabled.

`RASA_ANALYTICS_DB_URL=<DATA_LAKE_URL>`

### Ingest past conversations

When Analytics is connected to your Kafka instance, it will consume
all prior events on the Kafka topic and ingest them into the database.
Kafka has a retention policy for events on a [topic which defaults to
7 days](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/installation/configuration/topic-configs.html#topicconfigs_retention.ms).

If you want to process events from conversations that are older than the
retention policy configured for the Rasa topic, you can manually
ingest events from past conversations.

Manually ingesting data from past conversations requires a connection to the
tracker store. The tracker store contains past conversations and a
connection to the Kafka cluster. Use the `rasa export` command to export
the events stored in the tracker store to Kafka:

```shell
rasa export --endpoints endpoints.yml
```

Configure the export to read from your production tracker store
and write to Kafka as an event broker, e.g.

```yaml-rasa title="endpoints.yml"
  tracker_store:
      type: SQL
      dialect: "postgresql"
      url: "localhost"
      db: "tracker"
      username: postgres
      password: password

  event_broker:
      type: kafka
      topic: rasa-events
      url: localhost:29092
      partition_by_sender: true
```

:::note

Running manual ingestion of past events multiple times will result in
duplicated events. There is currently no deduplication implemented in
Analytics. Every ingested event will be stored in the database,
even if it was processed previously.

### Connect a BI Solution

Connecting a business intelligence platform to the data warehouse varies for
each platform. We provide example instructions for Metabase and Tableau but
you can use any BI platform which supports AWS Redshift or PostgreSQL.

#### Example: Connecting Metabase

Metabase is a free and open-source business intelligence platform. It
provides a simple interface to query and visualize data. Metabase can
be connected to PostgreSQL or Redshift databases.

- [Connecting Metabase to PostgreSQL](https://www.metabase.com/data_sources/postgresql)
- [Connecting Metabase to Redshift](https://www.metabase.com/data_sources/amazon-redshift)

#### Example: Connecting Tableau

Tableau is a business intelligence platform. It provides a flexible interface
to build business intelligence dashboards. Tableau can be connected to
PostgreSQL or Redshift databases.

- [Connecting Tableau to PostgreSQL](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/examples_postgresql.htm)
- [Connecting Tableau to Redshift](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/examples_amazonredshift.htm)

## Example Queries

Inspiration on how to analyze the conversations your assistant is having. The
example queries are created using Metabase.

### Daily Chatbot Users

#### Query using SQL

```sql
SELECT CAST(rasa_sender.first_seen AS date) AS "Date", COUNT(*) AS "Number of Users"
FROM rasa_sender
GROUP BY CAST(rasa_sender.first_seen AS date)
ORDER BY CAST(rasa_sender.first_seen AS date) ASC
```

#### Using the Metabase Query Builder

<div align="center">
  <img
    alt="Example query for a query showcasing the number of users per day."
    src={useBaseUrl("/img/analytics/number-of-users-query.png")}
    width="100%"
  />
</div>

#### Result

<div align="center">
  <img
    alt="Example result for a query showcasing the number of users per day."
    src={useBaseUrl("/img/analytics/number-of-users-result.png")}
    width="100%"
  />
</div>

## Data Structure Reference

Descriptions and examples of the data structure created by Analytics.
The data structure is created by the Analytics pipeline and treated as
a public API.

### rasa_session

The `rasa_session` table contains information about all conversation
sessions that users started with the assistant. New sessions are created
for every new user and for users who return to the assistant. The
conditions that trigger a new session to start can be
configured in the [Rasa Domain](./domain.mdx#session-configuration).

#### `id` session identifier

The unique identifier of the session. Every session gets a different,
generated id assigned.

Example: `63b150a6-21a3-4e6c-bb24-5ab6ddc30cf1`

#### `sender_id` sender who started the session

The unique identifier of the sender who started the session. It is a
foreign key to the [`rasa_sender.id`](#rasa_sender) column.

Example: `9e4ebded-f232-4cc5-af78-d98daa0c1a53`

#### `timestamp` creation date time

The timestamp when the session was created. The timestamp is a UTC.

Example: `2022-06-28 02:15:49.326936`

#### `start_sequence_number` start of the session

The sequence number of the first event in this session. All events belong
to exactly one session. The start sequence number is always smaller or equal
to the `end_sequence_number`. The difference between start and end sequence
numbers does not equal the number of events in this session since
sequence numbers are incremented across multiple conversations.

Example: `78`

#### `end_sequence_number` end of the session

The sequence number of the last event in the session.

Example: `91`

### rasa_event

The `rasa_event` table contains all events that an assistant created. Events
are created for every user message, bot response, and action that is executed
as well as for a lot of internal changes to a conversation session.
[Overview of all Rasa Events](./action-server/events.mdx).

#### `id` event identifier

The unique identifier of the event. Every event gets different,
generated id assigned.

Example: `f5adcd16-b18d-4c5c-95f0-1747b20cb0e6`

#### `sender_id` sender who's conversation the event belongs to

The unique identifier of the sender whose conversation this event is part of.
It is a foreign key to the [`rasa_sender.id`](#rasa_sender) column.

Example: `9e4ebded-f232-4cc5-af78-d98daa0c1a53`

#### `session_id` session identifier

The unique identifier of the session this event is part of.
It is a foreign key to the [`rasa_sender.id`](#rasa_sender) column.

Example: `9e4ebded-f232-4cc5-af78-d98daa0c1a53`

#### `timestamp` creation date time

The timestamp when the event was created. The timestamp is a UTC.

Example: `2022-06-28 02:15:49.326936`

#### `model_id` model identifier

The identifier of the Rasa model that was running as part of the assistant
when this event was created.

Example: `75a985b7b86d442ca013d61ea4781b22`

#### `sequence_number` start of the event

The sequence number of the event. The events of a session always have
increasing sequence numbers. Sequence numbers are not guaranteed to be
sequential for events following one another. But sequence numbers can
be used to order the events of a session.

Example: `78`

### rasa_bot_message

### rasa_user_message

### rasa_slot
