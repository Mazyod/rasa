You can query and
visualise metrics in a frontend tool of your choice (e.g. Metabase, PowerBI)

Measure the success of a Rasa assistant and making strategic investments
will lead to better business outcomes. It will also help you understand
the needs of your end users and better serve them.

Rasa Pro Analytics will start analyzing your conversations as soon as
the docker container is successfully deployed
and connected to your database and Kafka instances.

## Getting Started

### Ingesting past Conversational data

When Analytics is conencted to your Kafka instance, it will consume
all prior events on the Kafka topic and ingest them into the database.
Kafka has a retention policy for events on a [topic which defaults to
7 days](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/installation/configuration/topic-configs.html#topicconfigs_retention.ms).

If you want to process events from conversations that are older than the
retention policy configured for the Rasa topic, you can manually
ingest events from past conversations.

Manually ingesting data of past conversations requires a connection to the
tracker store that contains the past conversations and a connection to the
Kafka cluster. The `rasa export` command can be used to export the events
stored in the tracker store to Kafka:

```shell
rasa export --endpoints endpoints.yml
```

The export needs to be configured to read from your production tracker store
and write to Kafka as an event broker, e.g.

```yaml-rasa title="endpoints.yml"
  tracker_store:
      type: SQL
      dialect: "postgresql"
      url: "localhost"
      db: "tracker"
      username: postgres
      password: password

  event_broker:
      type: kafka
      topic: rasa-events
      url: localhost:29092
      partition_by_sender: true
```

:::note

Running manuall ingestion of past events multiple times will result in
duplicated events. There is currently no deduplication implemented in
Analytics. Every event which gets ingested will be stored in the database,
even if it has been processed previously.

## Example Queries

Inspiration on how to analyze the conversations your assistant is having. The
example queries are created using Metabase.

### Daily Chatbot Users

#### Query using SQL

```sql
SELECT CAST("public"."rasa_users"."FIRST_SEEN" AS date) AS "FIRST_SEEN", count(*) AS "count"
FROM "public"."rasa_users"
GROUP BY CAST("public"."rasa_users"."FIRST_SEEN" AS date)
ORDER BY CAST("public"."rasa_users"."FIRST_SEEN" AS date) ASC
```

#### Using the Metabase Query Builder

<div align="center">
  <img
    alt="Example query for a query showcasing the number of users per day."
    src={useBaseUrl("/img/analytics/number-of-users-query.png")}
    width="100%"
  />
</div>

#### Result

<div align="center">
  <img
    alt="Example result for a query showcasing the number of users per day."
    src={useBaseUrl("/img/analytics/number-of-users-result.png")}
    width="100%"
  />
</div>

</div>

### Table `rasa_actions`

The `rasa_actions` table contains information about all actions that got
executed by the assistant across all conversations.

| Column | Type        | Description                                   |
| :----- | :---------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| id     | varchar 255 | Unique ID of this event. Same as the event_id |
| ...    | ...         | ...                                           |
