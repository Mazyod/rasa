You can query and
visualise metrics in a frontend tool of your choice (e.g. Metabase, PowerBI)

Measuring a Rasa assistant's success and making strategic investments
will lead to better business outcomes. It will also help you understand
the needs of your end users and better serve them.

Rasa Pro will connect to your production assistant using Kafka.
The pipeline will compute analytics as soon as the docker container is successfully
deployed and connected to your data warehouse and Kafka instances.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A production deployment of Kafka is required to set up Rasa Pro.
  We recommend using [Amazon Managed Streaming for
  Apache Kafka](https://aws.amazon.com/msk/).
- A production deployment of a data lake needs to be connected to
  the data pipeline. Rasa Pro support the following data lakes:

  - [PostgreSQL](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql/) (**recommended**. All PostgreSQL >= 11.0 are supported)
  - [Amazon Redshift](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/)

  We recommend managed deployments of your data lake to minimise maintenance
  efforts.

### Connect an assistant

The `<DATA_LAKE_URL>` should have a DBAPI format, e.g.
`postgresql+psycopg2://user:password@postgres.host:5432/rasa`.
If no data lake URL is configured, [Analytics](../monitoring/analytics.mdx)
will be disabled.

`RASA_ANALYTICS_DB_URL=<DATA_LAKE_URL>`

### Ingest past conversations

When Analytics is connected to your Kafka instance, it will consume
all prior events on the Kafka topic and ingest them into the database.
Kafka has a retention policy for events on a [topic which defaults to
7 days](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/installation/configuration/topic-configs.html#topicconfigs_retention.ms).

If you want to process events from conversations that are older than the
retention policy configured for the Rasa topic, you can manually
ingest events from past conversations.

Manually ingesting data of past conversations requires a connection to the
tracker store. The tracker store contains the past conversations and a
connection to the Kafka cluster. Use the `rasa export` command to export
the events stored in the tracker store to Kafka:

```shell
rasa export --endpoints endpoints.yml
```

Configure the export to read from your production tracker store
and write to Kafka as an event broker, e.g.

```yaml-rasa title="endpoints.yml"
  tracker_store:
      type: SQL
      dialect: "postgresql"
      url: "localhost"
      db: "tracker"
      username: postgres
      password: password

  event_broker:
      type: kafka
      topic: rasa-events
      url: localhost:29092
      partition_by_sender: true
```

:::note

Running manuall ingestion of past events multiple times will result in
duplicated events. There is currently no deduplication implemented in
Analytics. Every ingested event will be stored in the database,
even if it was processed previously.

### Connect a BI Solution

Connecting a business intelligence platform to the data warehouse varies for
each platform. We provide example instructions for Metabase and Tableau but
you can use any BI platform which supports AWS Redshift or PostgreSQL.

#### Example: Connecting Metabase

[Connecting Metabase to Redshift](https://www.metabase.com/data_sources/amazon-redshift)

#### Example: Connecting Tableau to Rasa Pro Analytics

[Connecting Tableau to Redshift](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/examples_amazonredshift.htm)

## Example Queries

Inspiration on how to analyze the conversations your assistant is having. The
example queries are created using Metabase.

### Daily Chatbot Users

#### Query using SQL

```sql
SELECT CAST("public"."rasa_users"."FIRST_SEEN" AS date) AS "FIRST_SEEN", count(*) AS "count"
FROM "public"."rasa_users"
GROUP BY CAST("public"."rasa_users"."FIRST_SEEN" AS date)
ORDER BY CAST("public"."rasa_users"."FIRST_SEEN" AS date) ASC
```

#### Using the Metabase Query Builder

<div align="center">
  <img
    alt="Example query for a query showcasing the number of users per day."
    src={useBaseUrl("/img/analytics/number-of-users-query.png")}
    width="100%"
  />
</div>

#### Result

<div align="center">
  <img
    alt="Example result for a query showcasing the number of users per day."
    src={useBaseUrl("/img/analytics/number-of-users-result.png")}
    width="100%"
  />
</div>

</div>

### Table `rasa_actions`

The `rasa_actions` table contains information about all actions that got
executed by the assistant across all conversations.

| Column | Type        | Description                                   |
| :----- | :---------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| id     | varchar 255 | Unique ID of this event. Same as the event_id |
| ...    | ...         | ...                                           |
