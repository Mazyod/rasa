  Information about how best to scale up your bot to support parallel user activity
  and how you can use tracing to help debug issues.

:::note

Our team is currently in the process of running more extensive performance related tests, more information will be added here as we progress.

## Overview

In order to gather metrics on our system's ability to handle increased loads and users, we have performed tests to evaluate the maximum number of concurrent users a Rasa assistant can handle with certain machine configurations.
In each test case we spawned the following number of concurrent users at peak concurrency using a spawn rate of 1000 users per second. In our tests we used the Rasa [HTTP-API](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/pages/http-api),
along with common opensource load testing tool such as [locust](https://locust.io/).

|        Users             |               Configuration                        |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Up to 50,000             |         6vCPU, 16 GB                               |
| Up to 80,000             |         6vCPU, 16 GB but with almost 90% CPU usage |


### Debugging bot related issues while scaling up

To test our [Http-Apis](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/pages/http-api) ability to handle a large number of concurrent user activity we used Rasa Pro's [tracing](./tracing.mdx) capabilities
along with a tracing backend or collector, such as Jaeger, to collect traces for the bot under test.
