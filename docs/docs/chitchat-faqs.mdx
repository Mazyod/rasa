<!-- TODO: Restructure all conversations patterns pages to not depend on one another -->

After following the basics of [prototyping an assistant](./prototype-an-assistant.mdx), we'll
now walk through building a basic FAQ chatbot and then build a bot that can handle
contextual conversations.

<a aria-hidden="true" tabIndex="-1" className="anchor enhancedAnchor" id="build-faq-assistant"></a>

FAQ assistants are the simplest assistants to build and a good place to get started.
These assistants allow the user to ask a simple question and get a response. We're going to
build a basic FAQ assistant using features of Rasa designed specifically for this type of assistant.

In this section we're going to cover the following topics:

* [Responding to simple intents](./chitchat-faqs.mdx#respond-with-memoization-policy) with the MemoizationPolicy

* [Handling FAQs](./chitchat-faqs.mdx#faqs-response-selector) using the ResponseSelector

We're going to use content from [Sara](https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa-demo), the Rasa
assistant that, amongst other things, helps the user get started with the Rasa products.
You should [first install Rasa](installation.mdx)
and then [prototype an assistant](prototype-an-assistant.mdx)
to make sure you know the basics.

To prepare for this tutorial, we're going to start a new Rasa project:

```bash
rasa init
```

Let's remove the default content from this bot, so that the `data/nlu.yml`, `data/stories.yml`
and `domain.yml` files are empty.

<a aria-hidden="true" tabIndex="-1" className="anchor enhancedAnchor" id="respond-with-memoization-policy"></a>

## Memoization Policy

The MemoizationPolicy remembers examples from training stories for up to a `max_history`
of turns. One “turn” includes the message sent by the user and any actions the
assistant performed before waiting for the next message. For the purpose of a simple,
context-less FAQ bot, we only need to pay attention to the last message the user sent,
and therefore we'll set that to `1`.

You can do this by editing your configuration file as follows
(you can remove `TEDPolicy` for now):

```yaml title="config.yml"
policies:
- name: MemoizationPolicy
  max_history: 1
- name: MappingPolicy
```

:::note MappingPolicy
The `MappingPolicy` is there because it handles the logic of the `/restart` intent,
which allows you to clear the conversation history and start fresh.

:::

Now that we've defined our policies, we can add some stories for the `goodbye`, `thank` and `greet`
intents to our stories:

```yaml title="data/stories.yml"
stories:

- story: greet           # name of the story
  steps:
  - intent: greet        # intent of the user message
  - action: utter_greet  # reaction of the bot

- story: thank
  steps:
  - intent: thank
  - action: utter_noworries

- story: goodbye
  steps:
  - intent: bye
  - action: utter_bye
```

We'll also need to add the intents, actions and responses to our domain:

```yml title="domain.yml"
intents:
  - greet
  - bye
  - thank

responses:
  utter_noworries:
    - text: No worries!

  utter_greet:
    - text: Hi

  utter_bye:
    - text: Bye!
```

Finally, we'll copy over some user message training data from Sara to train our
intents (more can be found [here](https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa-demo/blob/master/data/nlu/nlu.md)):


```yaml title="data/nlu.yml"
nlu:
- intent: greet
  examples: |
    - Hi
    - Hey
    - Hi bot
    - Hey bot
    - Hello
    - Good morning
    - hi again
    - hi folks

- intent: bye
  examples: |
    - goodbye
    - goodnight
    - good bye
    - good night
    - see ya
    - toodle-oo
    - bye bye
    - gotta go
    - farewell

- intent: thank
  examples: |
    - Thanks
    - Thank you
    - Thank you so much
    - Thanks bot
    - Thanks for that
    - cheers
```

You can now train a first model and test the bot, by running the following commands:

```bash
rasa train
rasa shell
```

This bot should now be able to reply to the intents we defined consistently, and in any order.

For example:

<img alt="Memoization Policy Conversation" src={useBaseUrl("/img/memoization_policy_convo.png")} />

While it's good to test the bot interactively, we should also add end to end test cases that
can later be included as part of a [CI/CD system](./setting-up-ci-cd). End-to-end [test conversations](./testing-your-assistant#end-to-end-testing)
include NLU data, so that both components of Rasa can be tested.
The file `tests/conversation_tests.md` contains example test conversations. Delete all the test conversations and replace
them with some test conversations for your assistant so far:

```yaml title="tests/conversation_tests.yml"
e2e_tests:
- story: greet and goodybe
  steps:
  - user: |
     Hi!
    intent: greet
  - action: utter_greet
  - user: |
     Bye
    intent: bye
  - action: utter_bye

- story: greet and thanks
  steps:
  - user: |
     Hello there
    intent: greet
  - action: utter_greet
  - user: |
     thanks a bunch
    intent: thank
  - action: utter_noworries

- story: greet and thanks and goodbye
  steps:
  - user: |
     Hey
    intent: greet
  - action: utter_greet
  - user: |
     thanks you
    intent: thank
  - action: utter_noworries
  - user: |
     bye bye
    intent: bye
  - action: utter_bye
```

To test our model against the test file, run the command:

```bash
rasa test --stories tests/conversation_tests.yml
```

The test command will produce a directory named `results`. It should contain a file
called `failed_stories.yml`, where any test cases that failed will be printed. It will
also specify whether it was an NLU or Core prediction that went wrong.  As part of a
CI/CD pipeline, the test option `--fail-on-prediction-errors` can be used to throw
an exception that stops the pipeline.

## Response Selectors

The [ResponseSelector](components/selectors.mdx#responseselector) NLU component
is designed to make it easier to handle conversation patterns like small talk and
FAQ messages in a simple manner. By using the `ResponseSelector`, you only need one
story to handle all FAQs, instead of adding new stories every time you want to
increase your bot's scope.

People often ask Sara different questions surrounding the Rasa products, so let's
start with three intents: `ask_channels`, `ask_languages`, and `ask_rasax`.
We're going to copy over some user messages from the
[Sara training data](https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa-demo/blob/master/data/nlu/nlu.md)
into our training data. It's important that these intents have an `faq/` prefix, so
they're recognized as the faq intent by the `ResponseSelector`:

```yml title="data/nlu.yml"
nlu:
- intent: faq/ask_channels
  examples: |
    - What channels of communication does rasa support?
    - what channels do you support?
    - what chat channels does rasa uses
    - channels supported by Rasa
    - which messaging channels does rasa support?

- intent: faq/ask_languages
  examples: |
    - what language does rasa support?
    - which language do you support?
    - which languages supports rasa
    - can I use rasa also for another laguage?
    - languages supported

- intent: faq/ask_rasax
  examples: |
    - I want information about rasa x
    - i want to learn more about Rasa X
    - what is rasa x?
    - Can you tell me about rasa x?
    - Tell me about rasa x
    - tell me what is rasa x
```

Next, we'll need to define the responses associated with these FAQs in a new
file:

```yaml title="data/responses.yml"
responses:
  faq/ask_channels:
  - text: |
      We have a comprehensive list of [supported connectors](https://rasa.com/docs/core/connectors/), but if
      you don't see the one you're looking for, you can always create a custom connector by following
      [this guide](./connectors/custom-connectors.mdx).

  faq/ask_languages:
  - text: "You can use Rasa to build assistants in any language you want!"

  faq/ask_rasax:
  - text: "Rasa X is a tool to learn from real conversations and improve your assistant. Read more [here](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa-x/)"
```

The `ResponseSelector` should already be at the end of your pipeline configuration:

```yaml title="config.yml" {14-15}
language: en
pipeline:
  - name: WhitespaceTokenizer
  - name: RegexFeaturizer
  - name: LexicalSyntacticFeaturizer
  - name: CountVectorsFeaturizer
  - name: CountVectorsFeaturizer
    analyzer: "char_wb"
    min_ngram: 1
    max_ngram: 4
  - name: DIETClassifier
    epochs: 100
  - name: EntitySynonymMapper
  - name: ResponseSelector
    epochs: 100
```

Now that we've defined the message handling side, we need to make
the dialogue handling parts aware of these changes. First, we need to add the
new intents to our domain:

```yaml title="domain.yml"
intents:
  - greet
  - bye
  - thank
  - faq
```

We'll also need to add a [retrieval action](./retrieval-actions.mdx),
which takes care of sending the response predicted from the `ResponseSelector`
back to the user, to the list of actions. These actions always have to start
with the `respond_` prefix:

```yaml title="domain.yml"
actions:
  - respond_faq
```

Next we'll write a story so that the dialogue engine knows which action to predict:

```yml title="data/stories.yml"
stories:
- story: Some question from FAQ
  steps:
  - intent: faq
  - action: respond_faq
```

This prediction is handled by the `MemoizationPolicy`, as we described earlier.

After all of the changes are done, train a new model and test the modified FAQs:

```bash
rasa train
rasa shell
```

At this stage it makes sense to add a few test cases for our conversations:

```yaml title="tests/conversation_tests.yml"
e2e_tests:
- story: ask channels
  steps:
  - user: |
     What messaging channels does Rasa support?
    intent: faq
  - action: respond_faq

- story: ask languages
  steps:
  - user: |
     Which languages can I build assistants in?
    intent: faq
  - action: respond_faq

- story: ask rasa x
  steps:
  - user: |
     What's Rasa X?
    intent: faq
  - action: respond_faq
```

You can read more in this [blog post](https://blog.rasa.com/response-retrieval-models/) and the
[Retrieval Actions](./retrieval-actions.mdx) page.

Using the features we described in this tutorial, you can easily build a context-less assistant.

:::note Checklist
Here's a minimal checklist of files we modified to build a basic FAQ assistant:

* `data/nlu.yml`: Add NLU training data for `faq/` intents

* `data/responses.yml`: Add responses associated with `faq/` intents

* `config.yml`: Add `ResponseSelector` in your NLU pipeline

* `domain.yml`: Add a retrieval action `respond_faq` and intent `faq`

* `data/stories.yml`: Add a simple story for FAQs

* `tests/conversation_tests.yml`: Add E2E test stories for your FAQs
