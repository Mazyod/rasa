Large Language Models (LLMs), pretrained models using retrieval-augmented
generation, can be utilized with Rasa in several ways. This document offers an
overview of those usage patterns and how to handle them.

## A future-proof approach using generative models

The recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened up new
possibilities for conversational AI. LLMs are pretrained models that can be
fine-tuned to perform a variety of tasks, including intent classification,
dialogue handling, and natural language generation (NLG).

### An adjustable risk profile

The potential and risks of LLMs vary per use case, with more tolerance for error
internally than for customer-facing applications. As your organization becomes
more familiar with the technology, you may be more open to its uses, such as
enhancing the NLU pipeline, managing long-tail topics, or subtly altering bot
responses in low-risk situations.

It's essential that your system provides full
control over these processes. Understanding how LLMs and other components
behave and have the power to override any decision.

## Where to go from here

This section of the documentation guides you through the diverse ways you can
integrate LLMs into Rasa. We will delve into the following topics:

1. [Setting up LLMs](./llm-setup.mdx)
2. [Intentless Policy](./llm-intentless.mdx)
4. [LLM Intent Classification](./llm-intent.mdx)
5. [Response Rephrasing](./llm-nlg.mdx)

Each link will direct you to a detailed guide on the respective topic, offering
further depth and information about using LLMs with Rasa. By the end of this
series, you'll be equipped to effectively use LLMs to augment your Rasa
applications.
