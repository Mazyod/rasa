## Overview

This guide will walk you through the process of configuring Rasa to use OpenAI
LLMs, including deployments that rely on the Azure OpenAI service.

:::note

At the moment we are focused on supporting OpenAI LLMs, but we are working to
support other LLMs in the future.

:::

## Prerequisites

Before beginning, make sure that you have:

- Access to OpenAI's services
- Ability to generate API keys for OpenAI

## Configuration

Configuring LLMs to work with OpenAI involves several steps. The following
sub-sections outline each of these steps and what you need to do.

### API Token

The API token is a key element that allows your Rasa instance to connect and
communicate with OpenAI. This needs to be configured correctly to ensure seamless
interaction between the two.

To configure the API token, follow these steps:

1. If you haven't already, sign up for an account on the OpenAI platform.

2. Navigate to the [OpenAI Key Management page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys),
   and click on the "Create New Secret Key" button to initiate the process of
   obtaining your API key.

3. To set the API key as an environment variable, you can use the following command in a
   terminal or command prompt:

   <Tabs groupId="os-dist-api-key" values={[{"label": "Linux/MacOS", "value": "unix"}, {"label": "Windows", "value": "windows"}]} defaultValue="unix">
     <TabItem value="unix">

     ```shell
     export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
     ```

     </TabItem>
     <TabItem value="windows">

      ```shell
      setx OPENAI_API_KEY <your-api-key>
      ```

      This will apply to future cmd prompt window, so you will need to open a new one to use that variable

     </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

   Replace `<your-api-key>` with the actual API key you obtained from the OpenAI platform.

### Model Configuration

Rasa allow you to use different models for different components. For example,
you might use one model for intent classification and another for rephrasing.

To configure models per component, follow these steps described on the
pages for each component:

1. [Instructions to configure models for intent classification](./llm-intent.mdx)
2. [Instructions to configure models for rephrasing](./llm-nlg.mdx)

### Additional Configuration for Azure OpenAI Service

For those using Azure OpenAI Service, there are additional parameters that need
to be configured:

- `openai.api_type`: This should be set to "azure" to indicate the use of Azure
  OpenAI Service.
- `openai.api_base`: This should be the URL for your Azure OpenAI instance. An
  example might look like this: "https://docs-test-001.openai.azure.com/".


To configure these parameters, follow these steps:

1. To configure the `openai.api_type` as an environment variable:

   <Tabs groupId="os-dist-api-type" values={[{"label": "Linux/MacOS", "value": "unix"}, {"label": "Windows", "value": "windows"}]} defaultValue="unix">
     <TabItem value="unix">

     ```shell
     export OPENAI_API_TYPE="azure"
     ```

     </TabItem>
     <TabItem value="windows">

      ```shell
      setx OPENAI_API_TYPE "azure"
      ```

      This will apply to future cmd prompt window, so you will need to open a new one to use that variable

     </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

2. To configure the `openai.api_base` as an environment variable:

   <Tabs groupId="os-dist-api-base" values={[{"label": "Linux/MacOS", "value": "unix"}, {"label": "Windows", "value": "windows"}]} defaultValue="unix">
     <TabItem value="unix">

      ```shell
      export OPENAI_API_BASE=<your-azure-openai-instance-url>
      ```

     </TabItem>
     <TabItem value="windows">

      ```shell
      setx OPENAI_API_BASE <your-azure-openai-instance-url>
      ```

      This will apply to future cmd prompt window, so you will need to open a new one to use that variable

     </TabItem>
   </Tabs>


## Other LLM providers

We're continually working to support more LLMs in the future. If you have any
specific requests or need assistance with setup, feel free to reach out to us.

Remember, your feedback helps us improve and provide the features and support
you need.
