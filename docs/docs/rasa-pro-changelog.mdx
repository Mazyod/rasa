## Rasa Pro 3.3

### Rasa Plus 3.3

#### Features
- Tracing capabilities for your Rasa Pro assistant. Distributed tracing tracks requests as they flow through a distributed system (in this case: a Rasa assistant), sending data about the requests to a tracing backend which collects all trace data and enables inspecting it. With this version of the Tracing feature, Rasa Pro supports OpenTelemetry.
- `ConcurrentRedisLockStore` is a new lock store that uses Redis as a persistence layer and is safe for use with multiple Rasa server replicas.

### Rasa Pro Services 3.0

#### Features
- Analytics Data Pipeline helps visualize and process Rasa assistant metrics in the tooling (BI tools, data warehouses) of your choice. Visualizations and analysis of the production assistant and its conversations allow you to assess ROI and improve the performance of the assistant over time.
