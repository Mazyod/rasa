:::note Want to explore first?
You can explore Rasa Open Source online using the Rasa Playground even before you install.
At the end of the tutorial you can download the resulting assistant, install Rasa on
your machine and continue development locally.

## Quick Installation

**Isolate your python project using a virtual environment.**

<Tabs values={[{"label": "Ubuntu", "value": "ubuntu"}, {"label": "macOS", "value": "macos"}, {"label": "Windows", "value": "windows"}]}  groupId="operating-systems" defaultValue="ubuntu">
  <TabItem value="ubuntu">

  Create a new virtual environment by choosing a Python interpreter and making a `./venv` directory to hold it:

  ```bash
  python3 -m venv ./venv
  ```

  Activate the virtual environment:

  ```bash
  source ./venv/bin/activate
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="macos">

  Create a new virtual environment by choosing a Python interpreter and making a `./venv` directory to hold it:

  ```bash
  python3 -m venv ./venv
  ```

  Activate the virtual environment:

  ```bash
  source ./venv/bin/activate
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="windows">

  Create a new virtual environment by choosing a Python interpreter and making a `.\\venv` directory to hold it:

  ```bat
  C:\> python3 -m venv ./venv
  ```

  Activate the virtual environment:

  ```bat
  C:\> .\venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

**Install Rasa Open Source using pip (requires Python 3.7, or 3.8).**

```bash
pip3 install -U --user pip && pip3 install rasa
```

:::caution
The command above will upgrade your pip to the latest version. We recommend using pip 21.3 or later due to performance improvements. Previous versions would take long time to resolve dependencies.
:::

**You are now ready to go! So what's next? You can create a new project by running:**

```bash
rasa init
```

You can learn about the most important Rasa commands in the [Command Line Interface](../command-line-interface.mdx).

:::note
Due to lack of official TensorFlow support for the Apple M1, Rasa Open Source is currently unable to train a model using M1.
