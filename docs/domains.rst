Domain, Slots, and Actions
==========================

Domain
------

The ``Domain`` defines the universe in which your bot operates. It specifies exactly:

* which ``intents`` you are expecting to respond to
* which ``slots`` you wish to track
* which ``actions`` your bot can take

For example, the ``DefaultDomain`` has the following yaml definition (no slots here - but we will get there):

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/default_domain.yml
   :language: yaml

**What does this mean?**

An ``intent`` is a string like ``"greet"`` or ``"restaurant_search"``.
It describes what your user *probably meant to say*. 
For example, "show me Mexican restaurants", and "I want to have lunch"
could both be described as a ``restaurant_search`` intent. 


``slots`` are the things you want to keep track of during a conversation.
For example, in the messages above you would want to store "Mexican" as a cuisine type.
The tracker has an attribute like ``tracker.get_slot("cuisine")`` which will return ``"Mexican"``

``actions`` are the things your bot can actually do.
They are invoked by calling the ``action.run()`` method.
For example, an ``action`` can:

* respond to a user
* make an external API call
* query a database

Defining Custom Actions
:::::::::::::::::::::::


The easiest are ``UtterActions``, which just send a message to the user. You define them by adding an entry to the
action list that is named after the utterance. E.g. if there should be an action that utters the template called
``utter_greet`` you need to add ``greet`` to the list of defined actions. In the above example yaml you can see that
all three of the defined actions are just named after utter templates and hence just respond with a message to
the user.

**What about more complicated actions?**
To continue with the restaurant example, if the user says "show me a Mexican restaurant",
your bot would execute the action ``ActionCheckRestaurants``, which might look like this:


.. testcode::

   from rasa_core.actions import Action
   from rasa_core.events import SetSlot

   class ActionCheckRestaurants(Action):
      def name(self):
         return "check_restaurants"

      def run(self, dispatcher, tracker, domain):
         cuisine = tracker.get_slot('cuisine')
         q = "select * from restaurants where cuisine='{0}' limit 1".format(cuisine)
         result = db.query(q)

         return [SetSlot("matches", result if result is not None else [])]


Note that actions **do not mutate the tracker directly**.
Instead, an action can return ``events`` which are logged by the tracker and used to modify its 
own state.


Putting it all together
:::::::::::::::::::::::

Let's add just this one new action to a custom domain (assuming we stored the
action in a module called ``restaurant.actions``):

.. code-block:: yaml

   intents:
      - greet
      - default
      - goodbye

   entities:
      - name

   templates:
      utter_greet:
         - "hey there!"
      utter_goodbye:
         - "goodbye :("
      utter_default:
         - "default message"

   actions:
      - default
      - greet
      - goodbye
      - restaurant.actions.ActionCheckRestaurants


The point of this is just to show how the pieces fit together. As you can see, in the ``actions`` section
of your domain, you can list utter actions (which respond an utter template to the user) as well as custom
actions using their module path.

For an example you can run, check the :doc:`tutorial_scratch`.

.. _slot_types:

Slot Types
----------

Slots influence the prediction of the next action the bot should run. For the
prediction, the slots value is not used directly, but rather it is featurized.
E.g. for a slot of type ``text``, the value is irrelevant, for the featurization
the only thing that matters is if a text is set or not.

The choice of slot should be done with care. If a slots value should influence
the dialogue flow (e.g. the users age influences which question follows next)
you should choose a slot where the value influences the dialogue model.

These are all of the predefined slot classes and what they're useful for.


``type: boolean``
:::::::::::::::::
:Use For: True or False
:Description:
    Checks if slot is set and if True


``type: categorical``
:::::::::::::::::::::
:Use For: Slots which can take one of N values
:params: ``values``
:Description:
   Creates a one-hot encoding describing which of the ``values`` matched.


``type: data``
::::::::::::::
:Use For:  Base class for creating own slots
:Description:
   User has to subclass this and define the ``as_feature`` method containing
   any custom logic.


``type: float``
:::::::::::::::

:Use For: Continuous values
:params: ``max_value``, ``min_value``
:Description:
    Checks if float is within the range of min and max values.


``type: list``
::::::::::::::
:Use For: Lists of values
:Description:
    The feature of this slot is set to ``1`` if a value with a list is set,
    where the list is not empty. If no value is set, or the empty list is the
    set value, the feature will be ``0``.


``type: text``
::::::::::::::
:Use For: User preferences where you only care whether or not they've
          been specified.
:Description:
    Results in the feature of the slot being set to ``1`` if any value is set.
    Otherwise the feature will be set to ``0`` (no value is set).


``type: unfeaturized``
::::::::::::::::::::::
:Use For: Data you want to store which shouldn't influence the dialogue flow
:Description:
    There will not be any featurization of this slot, hence its value does
    not influence the dialogue flow and is ignored when predicting the next
    action the bot should run.
