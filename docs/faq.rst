Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Does it run with python 3?
--------------------------
No, at the moment it does not. If you want to speed up the process we would be very happy to receive your contributions.

Which languages are supported?
------------------------------
There is a list containing all officialy supported languages :ref:`here <section_languages>`. Nevertheless, there are
others working on adding more languages, feel free to have a look at the `github issues <https://github.com/golastmile/rasa_nlu/issues>`_
section or the `gitter chat <https://gitter.im/golastmile/rasa_nlu>`_.

.. _section_faq_version:

Which version of rasa NLU am I running?
---------------------------------------
To find out which rasa version you are running, you can execute

.. code-block:: python

   python -c "import rasa_nlu; print rasa_nlu.__version__"

If you are using a virtual environment to run your python code, make sure you are using the correct python to execute the above code.

Why am I getting an ``UndefinedMetricWarning``?
-----------------------------------------------
The complete warning is: ``UndefinedMetricWarning: F-score is ill-defined and being set to 0.0 in labels with no predicted samples.``
The warning is a result of a lack of training data. During the training the dataset will be splitted multiple times, if there are to few training samples for any of the intents, the splitting might result in splits that do not contain any examples for this intent. 

Hence, the solution is to add more training samples. As this is only a warning, training will still succeed, but the resulting models predictions might be weak on the intents where you are lacking training data. Â
