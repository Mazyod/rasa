Migration Guide
===============
This page contains information about changes between major versions and
how you can migrate from one version to another.

.. _migration-to-0-15-0:

0.14.x to 0.15.0

General
~~~~~~~

- The scripts in ``rasa.core`` and ``rasa.nlu`` can no longer be executed. To train, test, run, ... a rasa nlu or core
  model, you should now use the command line interface ``rasa``. The functionality is the same as before. If you run
  one of the old scripts in ``rasa.core`` or ``rasa.nlu`` an error is thrown that also points you to the command you
  should use instead.
  Mapping of old scripts to new commands:
  ``rasa.core.run`` -> ``rasa shell``
  ``rasa.core.server`` -> ``rasa run core``
  ``rasa.core.test`` -> ``rasa test core``
  ``rasa.core.train`` -> ``rasa train core``
  ``rasa.core.visualize`` -> ``rasa show``
  ``rasa.nlu.convert`` -> ``rasa data``
  ``rasa.nlu.evaluate`` -> ``rasa test nlu``
  ``rasa.nlu.run`` -> ``rasa shell``
  ``rasa.nlu.server`` -> ``rasa run nlu``
  ``rasa.nlu.test`` -> ``rasa test nlu``
  ``rasa.nlu.train`` -> ``rasa train nlu``


Script parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- the ``--num_threads`` parameter got removed from the ``run`` command. The
  server will always run single threaded, but in an async way. If you want to
  make use of multiple processes, feel free to check out the sanic server
  documentation https://sanic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sanic/deploying.html#running-via-gunicorn
