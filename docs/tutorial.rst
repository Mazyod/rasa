Rasa Tutorial
=============

This page explains the basics of building an assistant with Rasa and
shows the structure of a rasa project.


.. contents::

**Goal**

You will build a simple, friendly assistant which will ask you how you're doing
and send you a fun picture to cheer you up if you are sad.

1. Create a New Project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The first step is to create a new Rasa project. To do this, run:

.. runnable::
   :description: stack-init

   rasa init --no-prompt

The ``rasa init`` command creates the files that a Rasa project needs. 
If you leave out the ``--no-prompt`` flag you will be asked some questions about
how you want your project to be set up.

This creates the following files:


+-------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| ``__init__.py``               | an empty file that helps python find your actions      |
+-------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| ``actions.py``                | code for your custom actions                           |
+-------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| ``config.yml`` *              | configuration of your NLU and Core models              |
+-------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| ``credentials.yml``           | details for connecting to other services               |
+-------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| ``data/nlu.md`` *             | your NLU training data                                 |
+-------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| ``data/stories.md`` *         | your stories                                           |
+-------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| ``domain.yml`` *              | your assistant's domain                                |
+-------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| ``endpoints.yml``             | details for connecting to channels like fb messenger   |
+-------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| ``models/<timestamp>.tar.gz`` | your initial model                                     |
+-------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+



The most important files are marked with a '*'.
You will learn about all of these in this tutorial.


To check that all the files were created, run:

.. runnable::
   :description: stack-ls

   ls -1


2. Create NLU examples
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The first piece of a Rasa assistant is an NLU model.
NLU stands for Natural Language Understanding and means turning
user messages into structured data. To do this with Rasa,
you provide training examples that show how Rasa should understand
user messages, and then train a model by showing it those examples. 

Run the code cell below to see the NLU training data created by 
the ``rasa init`` command:

.. runnable::
   :description: stack-cat-nlu

   cat data/nlu.md

The lines starting with ``##`` define the names of your ``intents``, which
are groups of messages with the same meaning. Rasa's job will be to
predict the correct intent when your users send new, unseen messages to
your assistant. You can find all the details of the data format in :ref:`nlu-data-format`.

.. _model-configuration:

3. Define your model configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The configuration file defines the NLU and Core components that your model
will use. In this example, your NLU model will use the
``supervised_embeddings`` pipeline. You can learn all about NLU pipelines
`here <http://x-docs.rasa.com/docs/rasa/nlu/choosing-pipeline/>`_.

Let's take a look at your model configuration file.

.. runnable::
   :description: stack-cat-config

   cat config.yml


The ``pipeline`` and ``language`` keys specify how the NLU model should be built.
You can read more about this in :ref:`choosing_pipeline`.
The ``policies`` key defines the :ref:`policies` that the Core model will use.



4. Write Your First Stories
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

At this stage, you will teach your assistant to respond to your messages.
Dialogue is handled by Rasa's ``Core`` module.

Core models learn from real conversational data in the form of training "stories".
A story is a real conversation between a user and an assistant.
Lines with intents and entities reflect the user's input and action names show what the
assistant should do in response.

Below is an example of a simple conversation. 
The user says hello, and the assistant says hello back.
This is how it looks as a story:

.. code-block:: story

   ## story1
   * greet
      - utter_greet


You can see the full details in :ref:`stories-data-format`.

Lines that start with ``-`` are actions taken by the assistant.
In this case, all of our actions are messages sent back to the user,
like ``utter_greet``, but in general, an action can do anything,
including calling an API and interacting with the outside world.

Run the cell below to show the example stories inside the file ``data/stories.md`` :

.. runnable::
   :description: core-cat-stories

   cat data/stories.md


6. Define a Domain
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The next thing we need to do is define a ``Domain``.
The domain defines the universe your assistant lives in - what user inputs it
should expect to get, what actions it should be able to predict, how to
respond and what information to store.
Here is the domain for our assistant, it's saved in a 
file called ``domain.yml``:

.. runnable::
   :description: stack-cat-domain

   cat domain.yml


So what do the different parts mean?


+---------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``intents``   | things you expect users to say                              |
+---------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``actions``   | things your assistant can do and say                        |
+---------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``templates`` | template strings for the things your assistant can say      |
+---------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+


**How does this fit together?**
Rasa Core's job is to choose the right action to execute at each step
of the conversation. Simple actions are sending a message to a user.
These simple actions are the ``actions`` in the domain, which start
with ``utter_``. They will respond with a message based on a template
from the ``templates`` section. See
`Custom Actions <http://x-docs.rasa.com/docs/rasa/core/run-code-in-custom-actions/#id1>`_
for how to build actions that do more than just send a message.



7. Train a Model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The next step is to train a neural network on our example stories and NLU data.
To do this, run the command below. This command will call the Rasa Core and NLU train
functions, and store the trained model
into the ``models/`` directory. The output of this command will include
the training results for each training epoch.

.. runnable::
   :description: stack-train

   rasa train

   echo "Finished training."

The ``rasa train`` command will look for both NLU and Core data and will train a model for each.


8. Talk To Your Assistant
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Congratulations ðŸš€! You just built an assistant
powered entirely by machine learning.

The next step is to try it out!
First, repeat the steps in this tutorial on your own machine.
Then, start talking to your assistant by running:

.. copyable::

   rasa shell


You can also use Rasa X to collect more conversations
and improve your assistant:

.. button::
   :text: Try Rasa X
   :link: ../../rasa-x/
