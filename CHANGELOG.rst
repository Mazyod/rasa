Rasa Change Log
===============

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
This project adheres to `Semantic Versioning`_ starting with version 1.0.

[Unreleased 0.15.0.aX] - `master`_
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Added
-----

- option to create template for new utterance action in ``interactive learning``
- you can now choose actions previously created in the same session
in ``interactive learning``
- add formatter 'black'


Changed
-------
- changed removing punctuation logic in ``WhitespaceTokenizer``
- ``training_processes`` in the Rasa NLU data router have been renamed to ``worker_processes``
- created a common utils package ``rasa.utils`` for nlu and core, common methods like ``read_yaml`` moved there
- removed ``--num_threads`` from run command (server will be asyncronous but
  running in a single thread)
- removed ``--pre_load`` from run command (Rasa NLU server will just have a maximum of one model and that model will be
  loaded by default)
- changed file format of a stored trained model from the Rasa NLU server to ``tar.gz``

Removed
-------
- removed possibility to execute ``python -m rasa_core.train`` etc. (e.g. scripts in ``rasa.core`` and ``rasa.nlu``).
  Use the CLI for rasa instead, e.g. ``rasa train core``.
- removed ``_sklearn_numpy_warning_fix`` from the ``SklearnIntentClassifier``
- removed projects - Rasa NLU server has now only maximum one model at a time loaded, there is no notion of project
  anymore.

Fixed
-----
- the ``/evaluate`` route for the Rasa NLU server now runs evaluation
  in a parallel process, which prevents the currently loaded model unloading
- added missing implementation of the ``keys()`` function for the Redis Tracker
  Store
