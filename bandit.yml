# B322: checks for `input()` which is unsafe in Python 2, but safe in Python 3.
# B104: checks for binding 0.0.0.0 interface, which should be fine for containers.
# B301: checks for pickle usage, which is a necessary evil.
# B303: checks for insecure hash functions like md5, which is good enough for current use cases.
