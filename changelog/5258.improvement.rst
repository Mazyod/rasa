Added ``PikaEventBroker`` support for publishing to multiple queues. The former
``queue`` key is deprecated. Queues should now be specified as a list in the
``endpoints.yml`` event broker config under a new key ``queues``. Example config:

.. code-block:: yaml

  event_broker:
    type: pika
    url: localhost
    username: username
    password: password
    queues:
      - queue-1
      - queue-2
      - queue-3
