Added ``PikaEventBroker`` (:ref:`event-brokers-pika`) support for publishing to
multiple queues. Messages are now published to a ``fanout`` exchange with name
``rasa-exchange`` (see
`here <https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/amqp-concepts.html#exchange-fanout>`_
for more information on ``fanout`` exchanges).

The former ``queue`` key is deprecated. Queues should now be
specified as a list in the ``endpoints.yml`` event broker config under a new key
``queues``. Example config:

.. code-block:: yaml

    event_broker:
      type: pika
      url: localhost
      username: username
      password: password
      queues:
        - queue-1
        - queue-2
        - queue-3
