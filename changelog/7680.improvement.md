We're now running integration tests for Rasa, with initial coverage for `SQLTrackerStore` (with PostgreSQL),
`RedisLockStore` (with Redis) and `PikaEventBroker` (with RabbitMQ). The integration tests are now part of our
CI, and can also be ran locally using `make test-integration`
(see [Rasa Open Source README](https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa) for more information).
