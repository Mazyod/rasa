Expose diagnostic data for action and NLU predictions.

Add `diagnostic_data` field to the [Message](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/reference/rasa/shared/nlu/training_data/message#message-objects) 
and [Prediction](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/reference/rasa/core/policies/policy#policyprediction-objects) objects, which contain 
information about attention weights and other intermediate results of the inference computation.

DIET and TED now both expose the attention weights of their transformer layers.
This can be used for debugging and fine-tuning, e.g. with RasaLit.
