Removed `multidict` from the project dependencies. `multidict` continues to be a second
order dependency of Rasa Open Source but will be determined by the dependencies which
use it instead of by Rasa Open Source directly.

This resolves issues like the following:

```bash
sanic 20.9.1 has requirement multidict==5.0.0, but you'll have multidict 4.6.0 which is incompatible.
```
