Fix 2 issues detected with the HTTP API:
- The `GET /conversations/{conversation_id}/tracker` endpoint was not returning the tracker with all sessions when `include_events` query parameter was set to `ALL`.
The fix constituted in using `TrackerStore.retrieve_full_tracker` method instead of `TrackerStore.retrieve` method in the function handling the `GET /conversations/{conversation_id}/tracker` endpoint.
Implemented or updated this method across all tracker store subclasses.
- The `GET /conversations/{conversation_id}/story` endpoint was not returning all the stories for all sessions when `all_sessions` query parameter was set to `true`.
The fix constituted in using all events of the tracker to be converted in stories instead of only the `applied_events`.
