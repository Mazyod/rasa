Limit `numpy` version to `< 1.2` as `tensorflow` is not compatible with `numpy`
versions `>= 1.2`. `pip` versions `<= 20.2` don't resolve dependencies conflicts
correctly which could result in an incompatible `numpy` version and the following
error:

```bash
NotImplementedError: Cannot convert a symbolic Tensor (strided_slice_6:0) to a numpy array. This error may indicate that you're trying to pass a Tensor to a NumPy call, which is not supported
```
