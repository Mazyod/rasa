Fixed a bug where `rasa test --fail-on-prediction-errors` would raise a 
`WrongPredictionException` for entities which were actually predicted correctly.

This happened in two ways:
1. if for a user message some entities were extracted multiple times (by multiple entity
extractors) but listed only once in the test story,
2. if the order in which entities from a message were extracted didn't match the order
in which they were listed in the test story.
