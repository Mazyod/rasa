Added an option `constrain_similarities` which adds sigmoid cross-entropy loss on all similarity values to constrain them to an approximate range in `DotProductLoss`.

This affects the behaviour of the loss function(`loss_type=cross_entropy`) inside machine learning (ML) components - [DIETClassifier](components.mdx#dietclassifier), [ResponseSelector](components.mdx#dietclassifier) and [TEDPolicy](policies.mdx#ted-policy).
By default, the parameter is set to `False` but users are encouraged to set it to `True` and re-train their assistants as it will be set to `True` by default, Rasa Open Source 3.0 onwards.  
Once you re-train your assistant with this option set to `True`, you should also tune fallback confidence thresholds.

Configuration option `loss_type=softmax` is now deprecated. Use `loss_type=cross_entropy` instead.

Also, added an option `model_confidence` to each ML component. It affects how model's confidence for each label is computed during inference. It can take three values -
1. `softmax` - Similarities between input and label embeddings are post-processed with a softmax function, as a result of which confidence for all labels sum up to 1.
2. `cosine` - Cosine similarity between input label embeddings. Confidence for each label will be in the range `[-1,1]`.
3. `inner` - Dot product similarity between input and label embeddings. Confidence for each label will be in an unbounded range.

The default value is `softmax`, but we recommend using `cosine` as that will be the new default value, Rasa Open Source 3.0 onwards. The value of this option does not affect how confidences are computed for entity predictions in `DIETClassifier` and `TEDPolicy`.

The default auto-configuration is changed to use `constrain_similarities=True` and `model_confidence=cosine` in ML components so that new users start with the recommended configuration.
