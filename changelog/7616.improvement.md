Added sigmoid cross-entropy loss on all similarity values to constrain them to an approximate range in `DotProductLoss`.

This affects the default behaviour of the loss function(`loss_type=cross_entropy`) inside machine learning (ML) components - `DIETClassifier`, `ResponseSelector` and `TEDPolicy`.
If you notice a degradation in performance, set `constrain_similarities=False` in the respective ML component.

Configuration option `loss_type=softmax` is now deprecated. Use `loss_type=cross_entropy` instead.

Also, added an option `relative_confidence` to each ML component. Contrary to the default behaviour, if `relative_confidence` is set to `False`, the confidences for each label will be between 0 and 1 but they will not sum up to 1. It is also recommended to set `relative_confidence=False` as it will be made default in Rasa Open Source 3.0. You may need to tune fallback confidence thresholds after making this change.
