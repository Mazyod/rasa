Constrain similarity values to an approximate range in `DotProductLoss` by applying sigmoid over them during training.

This affects the default behaviour of the loss function(`loss_type=softmax`) inside machine learning(ML) components - `DIETClassifier`, `ResponseSelector` and `TEDPolicy`.
If you notice a degradation in performance, set `constrain_similarities=False` in the respective ML component.

Also, adds an option `relative_confidence` to each ML component. Contrary to the default behaviour, if `relative_confidence` is set to `False`, the confidences for each label will be between 0 and 1 but they will not sum up to 1.
