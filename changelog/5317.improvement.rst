Events exported using ``rasa export`` receive a message header if published through a
``PikaEventBroker``. The header is added to the message's ``BasicProperties.headers``
under the ``rasa-export-process-id`` key
(``rasa.core.constants.RASA_EXPORT_PROCESS_ID_HEADER_NAME``). The value is a
UUID4 generated at each call of ``rasa export``. The resulting header is a key-value
pair that looks as follows:

.. code-block:: text

  'rasa-export-process-id': 'd3b3d3ffe2bd4f379ccf21214ccfb261'
