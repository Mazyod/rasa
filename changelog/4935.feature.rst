Preparation for an upcoming change in the ``EmbeddingIntentClassifier``:

Add option ``use_cls_token`` to all tokenizers. If it is set to ``True``, the token ``__CLS__`` will be added to
the end of the list of tokens. Default is set to ``False``. No need to change the default value for now.

Add option ``return_sequence`` to all featurizers. By default all featurizers return a matrix of size
(1 x feature-dimension). If the option ``return_sequence`` is set to ``True``, the corresponding featurizer will return
a matrix of size (token-length x feature-dimension). See https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/nlu/components/#featurizers.
Default value is set to ``False``. However, you might want to set it to ``True`` if you want to use custom features
in the ``CRFEntityExtractor``.
See https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/nlu/entity-extraction/#passing-custom-features-to-crfentityextractor.

.. warning::

    These changes break model compatibility. You will need to retrain your old models!
