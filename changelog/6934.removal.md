[Conversation sessions](domain.mdx#session-configuration) are now enabled by default
if your [Domain](domain.mdx) does not contain a session configuration.
Previously a missing session configuration was treated as if conversation sessions
were disabled. You can explicitly disable conversation sessions using the following 
snippet:

```yaml-rasa title="domain.yml"
session_config:
  # A session expiration time of `0`
  # disables conversation sessions
  session_expiration_time: 0
```
