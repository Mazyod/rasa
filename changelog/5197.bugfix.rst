Fixed incompatibility of Oracle with the :ref:`sql-tracker-store`, by using a ``Sequence``
for the primary key columns. This does not change anything for SQL databases other than Oracle.
If you are using Oracle, please create a sequence with the instructions in the docs
:ref:`oracle-configuration`.
