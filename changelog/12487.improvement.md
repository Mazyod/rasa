Add an optional `description` key to the Markers Configuration format. This can be used to add documentation and context about it's usage. For example, a `markers.yml` can look like

``` yaml
marker_name_provided:
  description: “Name slot has been set”
  slot_was_set: name

marker_mood_expressed:
  description: “Unhappy or Great Mood was expressed”
  or:
    - intent: mood_unhappy
    - intent: mood_great
```
