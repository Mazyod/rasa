Made it explicit that interactive learning does not work with NLU-only models.

Interactive learning no longer trains NLU-only models if no model is provided
and no core data is provided.

Made the ``_story_files`` and ``_nlu_files`` attributes of the ``RasaFileImporter`` 
class public. They are now ``story_files`` and ``nlu_files``.
