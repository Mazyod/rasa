Add support for entities with roles and grouping of entities in Rasa NLU.

You can now define a role and/or group label in addition to the entity type for entities.
Use the role label if an entity can play different roles in your assistant.
For example, a city can be a destination or a departure city.
The group label can be use to group multiple entities together.
For example, you could group different pizza orders, so that you know what toppings goes with which pizza and
what size which pizza has.
For more details see :ref:`entities-roles-groups`.

To fill slots from entities with a specific role/group, you need to either use forms or use a custom action.
We updated the tracker method ``get_latest_entity_values`` to take an optional role/group label.
If you want to use a form, you can add the specific role/group label of interest to the slot mapping function
``from_entity`` (see :ref:`forms``).

.. note::

    Composite entities are currently just supported by the :ref:``diet-classifier``.
