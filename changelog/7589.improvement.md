Improved the machine learning models' codebase by factoring out shared feature-processing
logic into three custom layer classes:
- `ConcatenateSparseDenseFeatures` combines multiple sparse and dense feature tensors
into one.
- `RasaFeatureCombiningLayer` additionally combines sequence-level and sentence-level
features.
- `RasaSequenceLayer` is used for attributes with sequence-level features; it
additionally embeds the combined features with a transformer and facilitates masked
language modeling.
