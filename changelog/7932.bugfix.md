Fixed a bug when interpolating environment variables in YAML files which included `$` in their value. 
This led to the following stack trace:

```
ValueError: Error when trying to expand the environment variables in '${PASSWORD}'. Please make sure to also set these environment variables: '['$qwerty']'.
