Fixed default behavior of ``rasa test core --evaluate-model-directory`` when called without ``--model``. Previously, the latest model file was used as ``--model``. Now the default model directory is used instead.

New behavior of ``rasa test core --evaluate-model-directory`` when given an existing file as argument for ``--model``: Previously, this led to an error. Now a warning is displayed and the directory containing the given file is used as ``--model``.
