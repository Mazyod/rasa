Fixed a problem when using the `POST /model/test/intents` endpoint together with a 
[model server](model-storage.mdx#load-model-from-server). The error looked as follows:

```
ERROR    rasa.core.agent:agent.py:327 Could not load model due to Detected inconsistent loop usage. Trying to schedule a task on a new event loop, but scheduler was created with a different event loop. Make sure there is only one event loop in use and that the scheduler is running on that one.
```

This also fixes a problem where testing a model from a model server would change the
production model.
