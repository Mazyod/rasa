The endpoint ``PUT /conversations/<conversation_id>/tracker/events`` no longer
adds session start events (to learn more about conversation sessions, please
see :ref:`session_config`) in addition to the events which were sent in the request
payload. To achieve the old behavior send a
``GET /conversations/<conversation_id>/tracker``
request before appending events.
