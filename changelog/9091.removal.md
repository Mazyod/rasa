The fallback mechanism for spaCy models has now been removed in Rasa `3.0.0`. 

Rasa Open Source `2.5.0` introduced support for spaCy 3.0. This introduced a 
breaking feature because models would no longer be manually linked. To make
the transition smooth Rasa would rely on the `language` parameter in the
`config.yml` to fallback to a medium spaCy model if no model was configured
for the `SpacyNLP` component. In Rasa Open Source `3.0.0` and onwards the 
`SpacyNLP` component will require the model name (like `"en_core_web_md"`) 
to be passed explicitly.
