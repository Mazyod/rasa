Tracker stores supporting conversation sessions (``SQLTrackerStore`` and
``MongoTrackerStore``) do not save the tracker state to database immediately after
starting a new conversation session. This leads to the number of events being saved
in addition to the already-existing ones to be calculated correctly.

This fixes ``action_listen`` events being saved twice at the beginning of
conversation sessions.
