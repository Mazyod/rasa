Allow to have slots with values that result to a dictionary under the key `slot_was_set` (in `stories.yml` file).

An example would be to have the following story step in `stories.yml`:
```yaml
- slot_was_set:
    - some_slot:
        some_key: 'some_value'
        other_key: 'other_value'
```
This would be allowed if the `some_slot` is also set accordingly in the `domain.yml` with type `any`.
