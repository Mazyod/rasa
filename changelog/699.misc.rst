The `TEDPolicy <https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/core/policies/#ted-policy>`_
replaces the ``KerasPolicy`` in new Rasa projects generated with ``rasa init``.
The `TEDPolicy <https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/core/policies/#ted-policy>`_
is now the recommended machine learning policy. Please see the
`migration guide <https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/migration-guide/#rasa-1-7-to-rasa-1-8>`_
if you want to switch to this new policy in an existing project.
