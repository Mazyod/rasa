Hide dialogue turns predicted by `RulePolicy` in the tracker states
for ML-only policies like `TEDPolicy`
if those dialogue turns only appear as rules in the training data and do not appear in stories.

Add `set_shared_policy_states(...)` method to all policies.
This method sets `_rule_only_data` dict with keys:
- `rule_only_slots`: Slot names, which only occur in rules but not in stories.
- `rule_only_loops`: Loop names, which only occur in rules but not in stories.

This information is needed for correct featurization to hide dialogue turns that appear only in rules.
