Add a new required key (`assistant_id`) to `config.yml` to uniquely identify assistants in deployment.
The assistant identifier is extracted from the model metadata and added to the metadata of all dialogue events.
Re-training will be required to include the assistant id in the event metadata.

If the assistant identifier is missing from the `config.yml` or the default identifier value is not replaced, a random 
identifier is generated during each training.

An assistant running without an identifier will issue a warning that dialogue events without identifier metadata will be
streamed to the event broker.
