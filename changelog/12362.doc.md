Updated [knowledge base action docs](https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa/blob/main/docs/docs/action-server/knowledge-base-actions.mdx) to reflect the improvements made in `knowledge base actions` in Rasa 3.6 version. This enhancement now allows users to query for the `object` attribute without the need for users to request a list of `objects` of a particular `object type` beforehand. The docs update mentions this under `:::info New in 3.6` section.
