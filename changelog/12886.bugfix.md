Cache `EndpointConfig` session object using `cached_property` decorator instead of recreating this object on every request.
Initialize these connection pools for action server and model server endpoints as part of the Sanic `after_server_start` listener.
Also close connection pools during Sanic `after_server_stop` listener.
