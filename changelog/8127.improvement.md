Added detailed json schema validation for `UserUttered`, `SlotSet`, `ActionExecuted` and `EntitiesAdded` events both sent and received from the action server, as well as covered at high-level the validation of the rest of the 20 events.
In case the events are invalid, a `ValidationError` will be raised.
