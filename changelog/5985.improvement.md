Implemented model checkpointing for DIET (including the response selector) and TED. The best model during training will be stored instead of just the last model. The model is evaluated on the basis of `evaluate_every_number_of_epochs` and `evaluate_on_number_of_examples`.

Checkpointing is enabled iff the following is set for the models in the `config.yml` file:
* `checkpoint_model: True`
* `evaluate_on_number_of_examples > 0`

The model is stored to whatever location has been specified with the `--out` parameter when calling `rasa train nlu/core ...`.
