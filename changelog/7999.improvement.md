Replace `weight_sparsity` with `connection_density` in all transformer-based models and add guarantees about internal layers.

We rename `DenseWithSparseWeights` into `RandomlyConnectedDense`, and guarantee that even at density zero the output is dense and every input is connected to at least one output. The former `weight_sparsity` parameter of DIET, TED, and the ResponseSelector, is now roughly equivalent to `1 - connection_density`, except at very low densities (high sparsities). 

All layers and components that used to have a `sparsity` argument (`Ffnn`, `TransformerRasaModel`, `MultiHeadAttention`, `TransformerEncoderLayer`, `TransformerEncoder`) now have a `density` argument instead.
