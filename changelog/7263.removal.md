The [Pika Event Broker](event-brokers.mdx#pika-event-broker) no longer supports
the environment variables `RABBITMQ_SSL_CA_FILE` and `RABBITMQ_SSL_KEY_PASSWORD`.
You can alternatively specify `RABBITMQ_SSL_CA_FILE` in the RabbitMQ connection URL as 
described in the 
[RabbitMQ documentation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/uri-query-parameters.html).

```yaml-rasa title="endpoints.yml
event_broker:
 type: pika
 url: "amqps://user:password@host?cacertfile=path_to_ca_cert&password=private_key_password"
 queues:
 - my_queue

```

Support for `RABBITMQ_SSL_KEY_PASSWORD` was removed entirely.

The method [`Event Broker.close`](event-brokers.mdx) was changed to be asynchronous.
Support for synchronous implementations will be removed in Rasa Open Source 2.2.0.
To adapt your implementation add the `async` keyword:

```python
from rasa.core.brokers.broker import EventBroker

class MyEventBroker(EventBroker):

    async def close(self) -> None:
        # clean up event broker resources
```
