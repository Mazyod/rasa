Issue a UserWarning if a specified **domain folder** contains files that look like YML files but cannot be parsed successfully. 
Only invoked if user specifies a folder path in `--domain` paramater. Previously those invalid files in the specified folder were silently ignored.  
**Does not apply** to individually specified domain YAML files, e.g. `--domain /some/path/domain.yml`, those being invalid will still raise an exception.
