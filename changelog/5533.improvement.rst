Support for
`PostgreSQL schemas <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/ddl-schemas.html>`_ in
:ref:`sql-tracker-store`. The ``SQLTrackerStore``
accesses schemas defined by the ``POSTGRESQL_SCHEMA`` environment variable if
connected to a PostgreSQL database.

The schema is added to the connection string option's ``-csearch_path`` key, e.g.
``-options=-csearch_path=<SCHEMA_NAME>`` (see
https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/contrib-dblink-connect.html for more details). As
before, if no ``POSTGRESQL_SCHEMA`` is defined, Rasa uses the database's default
schema (``public``).

The schema has to exist in the database before connecting, i.e. it needs to have been
created with

.. code-block:: postgresql

  CREATE SCHEMA schema_name;
