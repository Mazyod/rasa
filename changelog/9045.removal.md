The option `model_confidence=linear_norm` is deprecated and will be removed in Rasa Open Source `3.0.0`.

Rasa Open Source `2.3.0` introduced `linear_norm` as a possible value for `model_confidence`
parameter in machine learning components such as `DIETClassifier`, `ResponseSelector` and `TEDPolicy`.
Based on user feedback, we have identified multiple problems with this option.
Therefore, `model_confidence=linear_norm` is now deprecated and
will be removed in Rasa Open Source `3.0.0`. If you were using `model_confidence=linear_norm` for any of the mentioned components,
we recommend to revert it back to `model_confidence=softmax` and re-train the assistant. After re-training,
we also recommend to [re-tune the thresholds for fallback components](./fallback-handoff.mdx#fallbacks).
