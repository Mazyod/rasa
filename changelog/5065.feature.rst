Add :ref:`LexicalSyntacticFeaturizer` to sparse featurizers.

``LexicalSyntacticFeaturizer`` does the same featurization as the ``CRFEntityExtractor``. We extracted the
featurization into a separate component so that the features can be reused and featurization is independent from the
entity extraction.
