Fix bug encountering:
``Error: No response phrases found for <out_of_scope/other>. 
Check training data files for a possible wrong intent name in NLU/NLG file`` 
during NLU pipeline comparison with ``ResponseSelector`` and NLG

When NLU training data is split before NLU pipeline comparison, 
NLG responses were not also persisted and therefore training for a pipeline including the ``ResponseSelector`` would fail.

NLG responses are now persisted along with NLU data to a ``/train`` directory in the ``run_x/xx%_exclusion`` folder.
