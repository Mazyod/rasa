External events and reminders now trigger intents (and entities) instead of actions.

Add new endpoint ``/conversations/<conversation_id>/trigger_intent``, which lets the user specify an intent and a
list of entities that is injected into the conversation in place of a user message. The bot then predicts and
executes a response action.
