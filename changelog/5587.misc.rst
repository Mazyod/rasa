Fixed misleading error message for a situation when ``rasa train nlu --nlu`` is given a file with a wrong format.

Before this change the output message was always: ``No NLU data given.``

Now in case the format is wrong the command prints: ``Path `nlu_data` doesn't contain valid NLU data in it. Please verify the data format. The NLU model training will be skipped now.``
