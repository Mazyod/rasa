Introduces a new policy called [`UnexpecTEDIntentPolicy`](./policies.mdx#unexpected-intent-policy).

`UnexpecTEDIntentPolicy` helps you [review conversations](./conversation-driven-development.mdx#review)
 and also allows your bot to react to unexpected user turns in conversations.
 It is an auxiliary policy that should only be used in conjunction with
 at least one other policy, as the only action that it can trigger
 is the special and newly introduced
 [`action_unlikely_intent`](./default-actions.mdx#action_unlikely_intent) action.

 The auto-configuration will include `UnexpecTEDIntentPolicy` in your
 configuration automatically, but you can also include it yourself
 in the `policies` section of the configuration:

 ```
 policies:
   - name: UnexpecTEDIntentPolicy
     epochs: 200
     max_history: 5
 ```

As part of the feature, it also introduces:

- [`IntentMaxHistoryTrackerFeaturizer`](./policies.mdx#3-intent-max-history)
  to featurize the trackers for `UnexpecTEDIntentPolicy`.
- `MultiLabelDotProductLoss` to support `UnexpecTEDIntentPolicy`'s multi-label training objective.
- A new default action called [`action_unlikely_intent`](./default-actions.mdx#action_unlikely_intent).


`rasa test` command has also been adapted to `UnexpecTEDIntentPolicy`:

- If a test story contains `action_unlikely_intent` and the policy ensemble does not trigger it, this leads to
  a test error (wrongly predicted action) and the corresponding story will be logged in `failed_test_stories.yml`.
- If the story does not contain `action_unlikely_intent` and Rasa Open Source does predict it then
  the prediction of `action_unlikely_intent` will be ignored for the evaluation (and hence not lead
  to a prediction error) but the story will be logged in a file called `stories_with_warnings.yml`.


The `rasa data validate` command will warn if `action_unlikely_intent` is
included in the training stories. Accordingly, `YAMLStoryWriter` and `MarkdownStoryWriter` have been updated to not dump `action_unlikely_intent` when writing stories to a file.

:::caution
The introduction of a new default action **breaks backward compatibility of previously trained models**.
It is not possible to load models trained with previous versions of Rasa Open Source. Please re-train
your assistant before trying to use this version.
