Added conversation sessions to trackers. A conversation session represents the
dialog between the agent and a user. Conversation sessions can begin in three ways: 1.
the user begins the conversation with the agent, 2. the user sends their first
message after a configurable period of inactivity, or 3. a manual session start is
triggered with the ``/session_start`` intent message. The period of inactivity after
which a new conversation session is triggered is defined in the domain using the
``session_length`` key in the ``config`` section. The introduction of
conversation sessions comprises the following changes:

- Added a new event ``SessionStarted`` that marks the beginning of a new conversation
  session.
- Added a new default action ``ActionSessionStart``. This action takes all
  ``SlotSet`` events from the previous session and applies it to the next session.
- Added a new default intent ``session_start`` which triggers the start of a new
  conversation session. ``SQLTrackerStore`` and ``MongoTrackerStore`` only retrieve
  events from the last session from the database.
