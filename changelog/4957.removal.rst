To use custom features in the ``CRFEntityExtractor`` use ``text_dense_features`` instead of ``ner_features``. If
``text_dense_features`` are present in the feature set, the ``CRFEntityExtractor`` will automatically make use of
them. Just make sure to add a dense featurizer in front of the ``CRFEntityExtractor`` in your pipeline and set the
flag ``return_sequence`` to ``True`` for that featurizer.
