`LabelTokenizerSingleStateFeaturizer` is deprecated. To replicate `LabelTokenizerSingleStateFeaturizer` functionality, add a `Tokenizer`  with `intent_tokenization_flag: True` and `CountVectorsFeaturizer` to the NLU pipeline. An example of elements to be added to the pipeline is shown in `changelog/6296.improvement.md`. 

 `BinarySingleStateFeaturizer` is deprecated and will be removed in the future. We recommend to switch to `SingleStateFeaturizer`.
