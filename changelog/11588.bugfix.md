Fixes scenarios in which a slot with `from_trigger_intent` mapping that specifies an `active_loop` condition was being filled despite that `active_loop` not being activated.
In addition, fixes scenario in which a slot with `from_trigger_intent` mapping without a specified `active_loop` mapping condition is only filled if the form gets activated.
Removes unnecessary validation warning that a slot with `from_trigger_intent` and a mapping condition should be included in the form's required_slots.
