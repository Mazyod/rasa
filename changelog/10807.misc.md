Domain loading was improved in certain areas:
- unified the different merging methods in order to use a single method in the case of both loading a list of paths and domain directory.
- extracted several general utility methods used in merging to `rasa/shared/utils/common.py`
- removed the `self.duplicates` attributes stored in the `Domain` instance and raised a warning instead when duplicates are found during merging
- removed the `Validator.verify_domain_duplicates` method making use of the `self.duplicates` removed attribute
- serialisation of `Domain` objects now uses the initial dictionary representation (rather than the re-transformed version used before);
