Setting `model_confidence=cosine` in `DIETClassifier`, `ResponseSelector` and `TEDPolicy` is removed. This was introduced in Rasa Open Source version `2.3.0` but post-release experiments suggest that using cosine similarity as model's confidences can change the ranking of predicted labels which is wrong. If a user had trained an assistant with `model_confidence=cosine` using any Rasa Open Source version between `2.3.0` and `2.3.2`, the assistant will have to be re-trained after removing the setting.

Additionally, using `model_confidence=inner` for `TEDPolicy` is also removed as it currently breaks the action selection logic in the ensemble of policies.

Therefore, it is now recommended to try `model_confidence=inner` for `DIETClassifier` and `ResponseSelector`, as
```yaml
- name: DIETClassifier
  model_confidence: inner
  constrain_similarities: True
- name: ResponseSelector
  model_confidence: inner
  constrain_similarities: True
```
This should still ease up tuning NLU fallback thresholds.

For `TEDPolicy`, users are suggested to stick to `model_confidence=softmax` for now. The option of `model_confidence=inner` for `TEDPolicy` will be made available in the future Rasa Open Source minor versions.

Also, `model_confidence=cosine` is removed from the configuration generated by [auto-configuration](model-configuration.mdx#suggested-config).
