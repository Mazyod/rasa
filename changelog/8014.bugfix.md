Setting `model_confidence=cosine` in `DIETClassifier`, `ResponseSelector` and `TEDPolicy` is deprecated and will be removed in the next Rasa Open Source minor version `2.4.0`. Using cosine similarity as model's confidences can change the ranking of predicted labels. Additionally, using `model_confidence=inner` for `TEDPolicy` is discouraged as it currently breaks the action selection logic in the ensemble of policies.

Therefore, it is recommended to try `model_confidence=inner` for `DIETClassifier` and `ResponseSelector` to ease up tuning fallback thresholds. Use `model_confidence=softmax` for `TEDPolicy`.
