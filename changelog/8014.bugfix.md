Setting `model_confidence=cosine` in `DIETClassifier`, `ResponseSelector` and `TEDPolicy` is deprecated and will be removed in the next Rasa Open Source minor version `2.4.0`. Experiments suggest that using cosine similarity as model's confidences can change the ranking of predicted labels. Additionally, using `model_confidence=inner` for `TEDPolicy` is discouraged as it currently breaks the action selection logic in the ensemble of policies.

Therefore, it is now recommended to try `model_confidence=inner` for `DIETClassifier` and `ResponseSelector`, as
```yaml
- name: DIETClassifier
  model_confidence: inner
  constrain_similarities: True
- name: ResponseSelector
  model_confidence: inner
  constrain_similarities: True
```
This should still ease up tuning NLU fallback thresholds.

For `TEDPolicy`, users are suggested to stick to `model_confidence=softmax` for now. The option of `model_confidence=inner` for `TEDPolicy` will be made available in the future Rasa Open Source minor versions.

Also, `model_confidence=cosine` is removed from the configuration generated by [auto-configuration](model-configuration.mdx#suggested-config).
