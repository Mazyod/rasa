Setting `model_confidence=cosine` in `DIETClassifier`, `ResponseSelector` and `TEDPolicy` is deprecated and will no longer be available. This was introduced in Rasa Open Source version `2.3.0` but post-release experiments suggest that using cosine similarity as model's confidences can change the ranking of predicted labels which is wrong.

Also, `model_confidence=inner` is deprecated and is replaced by `model_confidence=linear_norm` as the former produced an unbounded range of confidences which broke the logic of assistants in various other places.

Users are now encouraged to try `model_confidence=linear_norm` which will produce a linearly normalized version of dot product similarities with each value in the range `[0,1]`. This can be done as:
```yaml
- name: DIETClassifier
  model_confidence: inner
  constrain_similarities: True
```
This should ease up tuning fallback thresholds as confidences for wrong predictions are better distributed across the range `[0, 1]`.

If an assistant was trained with `model_confidence=cosine` or `model_confidence=inner` setting using previous versions of Rasa Open Source, it should be
re-trained by either removing the `model_confidence` option from the configuration or setting it to `linear_norm`

Also, `model_confidence=cosine` is removed from the configuration generated by [auto-configuration](model-configuration.mdx#suggested-config).
