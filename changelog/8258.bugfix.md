Fixed the bug that events from previous conversation sessions would be re-saved in the [`SQLTrackerStore`](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/tracker-stores#sqltrackerstore) or [`MongoTrackerStore`](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/tracker-stores#mongotrackerstore) when `retrieve_events_from_previous_conversation_sessions` was true.
