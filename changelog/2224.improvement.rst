Suppressed ``pika`` logs when establishing the connection. These log messages
mostly happened when Rasa X and RabbitMQ were started at the same time. Since RabbitMQ
can take a few seconds to initialize, Rasa X has to re-try until the connection is
established.
In case you suspect a different problem (such as failing authentication) you can
re-enable the ``pika`` logs by setting the log level to ``DEBUG``. To run Rasa Open
Source in debug mode, use the ``--debug`` flag. To run Rasa X in debug mode, set the
environment variable ``DEBUG_MODE`` to ``true``.
