Handle empty intent and entity mapping in the `domain`.

There is now an InvalidDomain exception raised if in the `domain.yml` file there are empty intent or entity mappings. 
An example of empty intent and entity mappings is the following :
```yaml-rasa
intents:
  - greet:
  - goodbye:

entities:
  - cuisine:
  - number:
```
