Fix `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'send_response'` caused by retrieving tracker via `GET /conversations/{conversation_id}/tracker` endpoint when `action_session_start` is customized in a custom action.
This was addressed by passing an instance of `CollectingOutputChannel` to the method retrieving the tracker from the `MessageProcessor`.
