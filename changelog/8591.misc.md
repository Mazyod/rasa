Tensorflow models now return batch dimension on the first axis and number of layers on the second axis for output array associated with `attention_weights` key.

Previously, the expected shape of the output array was - `(num_layers, batch_size, num_heads, length, length)`. Now, the expected shape of the output array is `(batch_size, num_layers, num_heads, length, length)`.
