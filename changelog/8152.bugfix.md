The file `failed_test_stories.yml` (generated by `rasa test`) now also includes the wrongly predicted entity as a comment next to the entity of a user utterance.
Additionally, the comment printed next to the intent of a user utterance is printed only if the intent was wrongly predicted (irrelevantly if there was a wrongly predicted entity or not in the specific user utterance).
