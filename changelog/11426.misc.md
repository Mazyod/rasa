Upgrade `prompt-toolkit` to version `3.0.28` instead of latest version because of breaking changes introduced in `prompt-toolkit` version `3.0.29` to unit test interface.
Replaced sync method `questionary.ask` with `ask_async` in `rasa/core/channels/console.py`, `rasa/cli/utils.py` and `rasa/core/training/interactive.py`.
