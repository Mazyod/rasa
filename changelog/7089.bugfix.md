Fix `ConveRTTokenizer` failing because of wrong model URL by making `model_url` parameter of `ConveRTTokenizer` mandatory.

Since the ConveRT model was taken [offline](https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa/issues/6806), we can no longer use 
the earlier public URL of the model. Additionally, since the licence for the model is unknown, 
we cannot host it ourselves. Users can still use the component by setting `model_url` to a community/self-hosted 
model URL or path to a local directory containing model files.
