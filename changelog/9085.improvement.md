Add support for `cafile` parameter in `endpoints.yaml`.
This will load a custom local certificate file and use it when making requests to that endpoint.

For example:

```yaml
action_endpoint:
  url: https://localhost:5055/webhook
  cafile: ./cert.pem
```

This means that requests to the action server `localhost:5055` will use the certificate `cert.pem` located in the current working directory.
