If you are using the feature [Entity Roles and Groups](nlu-training-data.mdx#entity-roles-and-groups), you should now also list the roles and groups
in your domain file. For example:
```yaml-rasa
entities:
  - city:
      roles:
        - from
        - to
  - name
  - topping:
      groups:
        - 1
        - 2
  - size:
      groups:
        - 1
        - 2
```

Entity roles and groups can now influence dialogue predictions. For more information see the section
[Entity Roles and Groups influencing dialogue predictions](nlu-training-data.mdx#entity-roles-and-groups-influencing-dialogue-predictions).
