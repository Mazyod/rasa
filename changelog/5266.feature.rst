Added a new NLU component :ref:`DIETClassifier <diet-classifier>` and a new policy :ref:`TEDPolicy <ted-policy>`.

DIET (Dual Intent and Entity Transformer) is a multi-task architecture for intent classification and entity
recognition. You can read more about this component in our :ref:`documentation <diet-classifier>`.
The new component will replace the :ref:`EmbeddingIntentClassifier <embedding-intent-classifier>` and the
:ref:`CRFEntityExtractor` in the future.
Those two components are deprecated from now on.
See :ref:`migration guide <migration-to-rasa-1.8>` for details on how to
switch to the new component.

:ref:`TEDPolicy <ted-policy>` is the new name for :ref:`EmbeddingPolicy <embedding_policy>`.
``EmbeddingPolicy`` is deprecated from now on.
The functionality of ``TEDPolicy`` and ``EmbeddingPolicy`` is the same.
Please update your configuration file to use the new name for the policy.
