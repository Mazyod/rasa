Added a new NLU components ``DIETClassifier`` and a new policy ``TEDPolicy``.

DIET (Dual Intent and Entity Transformer) is a multi-task architecture for intent classification and entity
recognition. You can read more about this component in our
`documentation <https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/nlu/components/#diet-classifier>`_.
The new component will replace the ``EmbeddingIntentClassifier`` and the ``CRFEntityExtractor`` in the future.
Those two components are deprecated from now on.
See `migration guide <https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/migration-guide/#rasa-1-7-to-rasa-1-8>`_ for details on how to
switch to the new component.

``TEDPolicy`` is the new name for ``EmbeddingPolicy``. ``EmbeddingPolicy`` is deprecated from now on.
The functionality of ``TEDPolicy`` and ``EmbeddingPolicy`` is the same. Please update your configuration file
to use the new name for the policy.
