`weight_sparsity` has been removed. Developers should replace it with `connection_density` in the following way: `connection_density` = 1-`weight_sparsity`.

`softmax` is not available as a `loss_type` anymore.

`linear_norm` was removed. Developers should replace it with `softmax` as a `model_confidence`.

From now on, instead of `minibatch`, `tensorboard_log_level` should be set to `batch`. 

Removed some deprecation warnings for core config.
