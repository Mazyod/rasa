`SlotSet` events will be emitted when the value set by the custom action is the same as the existing value of the slot. This was fixed for `AugmentedMemoizationPolicy` to work properly with truncated trackers.

To restore the previous behaviour, the custom action can return a SlotSet only if the slot value has changed. For example,

```
class CustomAction(Action):
    def name(self) -> Text:
        return "custom_action"

    def run(self, dispatcher: CollectingDispatcher,
            tracker: Tracker,
            domain: Dict[Text, Any]) -> List[Dict[Text, Any]]:
        # current value of the slot
        slot_value = tracker.get_slot('my_slot')

        # value of the entity
        # this is parsed from the user utterance
        entity_value = next(tracker.get_latest_entity_values("entity_name"), None)

        if slot_value != entity_value:
          return[SlotSet("my_slot", entity_value)]
```
