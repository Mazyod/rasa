Integrate language models from HuggingFace's `Transformers <https://github.com/huggingface/transformers>`_ Library.

Add a new NLP component `HFTransformersNLP <https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/nlu/components.html#hftransformersnlp>`_ which
tokenizes and featurizes incoming messages using a specified pre-trained model with the Transformers library as the backend.
Add ``LanguageModelTokenizers`` and ``LanguageModelFeaturizers`` which use the information from ``HFTransformersNLP``
and sets them correctly for message object.
Language models currently supported: BERT, OpenAIGPT, GPT-2, XLNet, DistilBert, RoBERTa
