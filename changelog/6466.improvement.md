[Response Selectors](retrieval-actions.mdx) are now trained on retrieval intent labels by default instead of the actual response text. For most models, this should improve training time and accuracy of the `ResponseSelector`.

If you want to revert to the pre-2.0 default behavior, add the `use_text_as_label: true` parameter to your `ResponseSelector` component.

You can now also have multiple response templates for a single sub-intent of a retrieval intent. The first response template
containing the text attribute is picked for training(if `use_text_as_label=True`) and a random template is picked for bot's utterance just as how other `utter_` templates are picked.

All response selector related evaluation artifacts - `report.json, successes.json, errors.json, confusion_matrix.png` now use the sub-intent of the retrieval intent instead of the actual response text.
