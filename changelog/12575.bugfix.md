Extract conditional response variation and channel variation filtering logic into a separate component.
Enable usage of this component in the NaturalLanguageGenerator subclasses (e.g. CallbackNaturalLanguageGenerator, TemplatedNaturalLanguageGenerator).
Amend nlg_request_format to include a single response ID string field, instead of a list of IDs.
