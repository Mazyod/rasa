Implements a new subclass of `LockStore` entitled `ConcurrentRedisLockStore` that handles concurrent scenarios when separate Rasa instances are trying to acquire the lock at the same time.
A deprecation warning was issued for `RedisLockStore` which will be removed in version `4.0.0` in favour of the new concurrent implementation.
