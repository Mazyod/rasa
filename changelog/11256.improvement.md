In order to handle messages received in parallel for the same conversation by different Rasa instances, implements a new subclass of `LockStore` entitled `ConcurrentRedisLockStore`.
This subclass ensures that only one instance can handle a conversation at any point in time.

In order to inform about this improvement, a warning will be issued when using prior `RedisLockStore` without setting the new `concurrent_mode` key to `True`.
