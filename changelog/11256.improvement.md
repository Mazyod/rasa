In order to handle messages received in parallel for the same conversation by different Rasa instances, implements a new subclass of `LockStore` entitled `ConcurrentRedisLockStore`.
This subclass ensures that only one instance can handle a conversation at any point in time.

A deprecation warning will be issued for the usage of the prior `RedisLockStore`. It will be removed in version `4.0.0` in favour of the new concurrent implementation.
