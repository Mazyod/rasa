Fixed a problem when slots of type `text` or `list` were referenced by name only in 
the training data and this was treated as an empty value. This means that the two
following stories are equivalent in case the slot type is `text`:

```yaml
stories:
- story: Story referencing slot by name
  steps:
  - intent: greet
  - slot_was_set:
    - name

- story: Story referencing slot with name and value
  steps:
  - intent: greet
  - slot_was_set:
    - name: "some name"

```

Note that you still need to specify values for all other slot types as only `text`
and `list` slots are featurized in a binary fashion.
