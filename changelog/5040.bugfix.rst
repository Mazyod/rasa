Change dependency Networkx from featurizers ``setup.py`` and ``requirements.txt``.

There is an imcompatibility between Rasa dependecy requests 2.22.0 and the own depedency from Rasa for networkx raising errors upon pip install. There is also a bug corrected in ``requirements.txt`` which used ``~=`` instead of ``==``. All of these are fixed using networkx 2.4.0.
