Added more debugging logs to the [lock store documentation](./lock-stores.mdx) to 
simplify debugging in case of connection problems.

Added a new parameter `socket_timeout` to the `RedisLockStore`. If Redis doesn't
answer within `socket_timeout` seconds to requests from Rasa Open Source, an error
is raised. This avoids seemingly infinitely blocking connections and exposes connection
problems early.
