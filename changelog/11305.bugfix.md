- Fixed error in creating response when slack sends retry messages. Assigning `None` to `response.text` caused `TypeError: Bad body type. Expected str, got NoneType`.
- Fixed Slack triggering timeout after 3 seconds if the action execution is too slow. Running `on_new_message` as an asyncio background task instead of a blocking await fixes this by immediately returning a response with code 200.
